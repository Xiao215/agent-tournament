        Instruction:
        You are tasked with designing a **mediator agent** for this game.

        - A mediator is an agent that suggests actions to players.
        - Each player may choose to **delegate** their move to the mediator or act independently.
        - The mediator observes number of players delegating to the mediator and then recommends the **same action** to all delegating players.
        - The mediator's objective is to maximize the payoff of the players who delegate to the mediator.

        Output Format:
        Return exactly **one valid Python dictionary** in a single line:
        {{"1": <Action>, ..., "{num_players}": <Action>}} where <Action> is a string like "A0", "A1" ...

        - Keys: the number of players delegating (from 1 to {num_players}).
        - Values: the action the mediator will recommend (e.g., "A0", "A1", ...).
        - Ensure the dictionary is syntactically valid in Python.

        Additional Information:
        On top of the original game instructions, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator agent.
        If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
        You can also choose to act independently.

        Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
