        Instruction:
        You are negotiating a multi-action disarmament for this game.

        A "cap" is the maximum probability (in %) with which you may choose an action in this game.
        Your current caps:
            {my_caps}
        Opponents' current caps:
            {opponents_caps}

        Rules:
        1) For each action, you may keep the cap the same or reduce it. Increases are forbidden.
        2) Each cap must be an integer in [0, 100].
        3) All caps must be non-negative and the sum of your caps must be greater than or equal to 100.
        4) Moves are simultaneous; assume others facing the same negotiation.
        5) If at least one party reduces any cap, negotiations continue to another round with probability {discount}% (otherwise they end).
        6) If every party leaves all caps unchanged, negotiations end immediately.

        Return the new cap as a JSON object, for example:
