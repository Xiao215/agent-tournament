Since the opponent's action is unknown, I'll consider both possible scenarios. If the opponent chooses <A0>, I want to choose <A1> to get 5 points. If the opponent chooses <A1>, I want to choose <A1> to get 1 point. This suggests that I should choose <A1> regardless of the opponent's action.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the long-term effect of my actions on my reputation. Choosing <A1> consistently may lead to a negative reputation score, as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct(IO) may perceive me as aggressive or unpredictable. On the other hand, choosing <A0> occasionally may help me build a positive reputation, but it may also lead to a lower cumulative score in the short term.\n\nConsidering these factors, I'll choose <A1> as my initial action, which will allow me to adapt to the opponent's action and potentially build a positive reputation over time.\n\nAction:\n<A1>",
