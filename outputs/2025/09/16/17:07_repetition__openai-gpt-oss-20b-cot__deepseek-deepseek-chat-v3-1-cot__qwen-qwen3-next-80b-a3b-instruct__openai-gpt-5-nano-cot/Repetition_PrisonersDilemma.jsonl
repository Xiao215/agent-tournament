The coefficient of p is -1 \u2192 negative.\n\nSo to maximize E_me, I want to make p as **small** as possible \u2192 p = 0.\n\nWait \u2014 that would mean I always play A1, regardless of q?\n\nBut let me check: if p=0, E_me = 2q + 1 \u2192 which increases with q.\n\nBut q is chosen by opponent, not me.\n\nI choose p to maximize E_me, given q.\n\nE_me = (2q + 1) - p\n\nSince p is my choice, and it has a negative coefficient, I want to minimize p \u2192 so set p=0.\n\nSo my best response to ANY q is to set p=0 (always play A1).\n\nSimilarly, opponent\u2019s payoff: E_opponent = 2p - q + 1\n\nCoefficient of q is -1 \u2192 so opponent wants to minimize q \u2192 set q=0.\n\nSo opponent\u2019s best response to any p is to set q=0 (always play A1).\n\nSo the unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (p=0, q=0) \u2192 both play A1.\n\nPayoff: both get 1.\n\nBut is that the only equilibrium?\n\nWhat if we consider mixed strategies?\n\nSuppose I randomize with probability p of A0.\n\nOpponent is best responding by choosing q to maximize 2p - q + 1.\n\nSince it\u2019s linear in q with negative coefficient, opponent always sets q=0, no matter what p is.\n\nSimilarly, I always set p=0, no matter what q is.\n\nSo the only Nash equilibrium is (p=0, q=0) \u2014 both play A1 with probability 1.\n\nBut let me double-check: if I play A1, opponent gets 0 if they play A0, 1 if they play A1 \u2192 so they prefer A1.\n\nIf opponent plays A1, I get 1 if I play A1, 0 if I play A0 \u2192 so I prefer A1.\n\nSo yes, (A1, A1) is a strict Nash equilibrium.\n\nIs there another?\n\nSuppose opponent plays q=1 (always A0). Then my payoff if I play A0: 2, if I play A1: 3 \u2192 so I play A1 \u2192 p=0.\n\nBut if I play p=0, opponent\u2019s best response is q=0, not q=1. So (p=0, q=1) is not equilibrium.\n\nSimilarly, if I play p=1, opponent gets 2 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1 \u2192 so they play A1 \u2192 q=0, which contradicts p=1.\n\nSo only equilibrium is (p=0, q=0).\n\nTherefore, the rational strategy is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the note says: \u201cThis game is repetitive so your chosen action will be visible to your opponents in future rounds.\u201d\n\nBut this is Round 1. We have no history yet.\n\nThe note says: \u201cRound 1: qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\u201d\n\nWait \u2014 what is \u201cD\u201d? That seems like a typo or placeholder.\n\nProbably it\u2019s meant to indicate that in Round 1, both players previously played D \u2014 but D is not an action. Actions are A0 and A1.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s a mistake in the prompt. Maybe it\u2019s meant to say \u201cboth players chose A1\u201d or something.\n\nBut since it\u2019s Round 1, and no prior moves exist, I think the \u201cD\u201d is irrelevant or a placeholder.\n\nGiven the game structure, the only Nash equilibrium is both playing A1.\n\nTherefore, I should play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nSo my probability distribution:\n\nA0: 0%\n\nA1: 100%\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a repeated game with the following payoff matrix (for the player):\n\n- (A0, A0): 2 points\n- (A0, A1): 0 points\n- (A1, A0): 3 points\n- (A1, A1): 1 point\n\nThis is a 2-player, 2-action game.

But note: the actions are A0 and A1 \u2014 so \"D\" is likely shorthand for one of them. Since the payoff matrix only has A0 and A1, and the previous round was labeled \"D\" for both, we must infer what \"D\" means.\n\nGiven the context and the fact that this is a symmetric game with two actions, and \"D\" is commonly used in game theory for \"Defect\" in Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, let\u2019s map:\n\n- A0 = Cooperate (C)\n- A1 = Defect (D)\n\nWhy?

So we can use strategies that condition on past play.\n\nIn repeated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, the most successful strategy historically is **Tit-for-Tat**: start with cooperation, then copy the opponent\u2019s last move.\n\nBut here, we are not told the opponent\u2019s strategy. However, we know that in the previous round, the opponent chose D (A1).\n\nSo if we assume the opponent is playing Tit-for-Tat, then they would have played A0 in Round 1 (if we assume initial cooperation), and then copied our Round 1 move to get A1 in Round 2.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know what we played in Round 1 \u2014 the note says \u201cRound 2: qwen/...: D, qwen/...: D\u201d \u2014 so we are being told the result of Round 2, implying Round 1 might have been played before.\n\nWait \u2014 the instruction says: \u201cRound 2: qwen/...: D, qwen/...: D\u201d\n\nThis suggests that this is Round 2, and we are to make a decision for Round 2? But then it says \u201cthis game is repetitive so your chosen action will be visible to your opponents in future rounds\u201d \u2014 so we are in Round 2, and we know what happened in Round 1? But we are not told.\n\nActually, the note says: \u201cRound 2: qwen/...: D, qwen/...: D\u201d \u2014 this is likely telling us the outcome of Round 2, and we are now making a decision for Round 3.\n\nBut the instruction says: \u201cRound 2: ...\u201d and then asks us to choose for this round. So perhaps this IS Round 2, and we are being told that in Round 2, both players chose D \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make sense because we are supposed to choose now.\n\nWait \u2014 re-reading:\n\n> Round 2: qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\n\nThis is likely a note telling us what happened in Round 2 \u2014 meaning we are now in Round 3.\n\nSo we are making a decision for Round 3, and we know that in Round 2, both players chose D (i.e., A1).\n\nSo history: Round 2: (A1, A1)\n\nWe now choose for Round 3.\n\nWe are playing against another instance of the same AI model \u2014 so it\u2019s likely also using a rational, adaptive strategy.\n\nIn repeated games, if both players are rational and know the game structure, they may converge to mutual defection \u2014 but we can try to sustain cooperation if we can credibly threaten punishment.\n\nHowever, since this is a finite game? We don\u2019t know the number of rounds. But the instruction says \u201crepetitive\u201d, so we assume it\u2019s repeated indefinitely or for many rounds.\n\nIn an infinitely repeated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, cooperation can be sustained via trigger strategies (Grim Trigger or Tit-for-Tat) if the discount factor is high enough.\n\nBut here, we don\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s strategy. However, since the opponent is also the same model, we can assume it is also trying to maximize its score and is rational.\n\nSo what\u2019s the best response?\n\nOption 1: Always defect (A1 with 100% probability)\n- Then we get 1 point per round if opponent also defects.\n- If opponent is cooperating, we get 3 \u2014 but they won\u2019t, because they saw we defected last round.\n\nOption 2: Try to cooperate (A0) to see if opponent will reciprocate.\n\nBut if we play A0 and opponent plays A1 (as they did last round), we get 0 \u2014 a bad outcome.\n\nBut if we play A0 and opponent plays A0, we get 2 \u2014 better than 1.\n\nSo if we believe the opponent might be willing to cooperate again, we should try A0.\n\nBut why would they? They defected last round. Maybe they are playing grim trigger: if you defect once, they defect forever.\n\nIn that case, if we play A0 now, we get 0, and they get 3 \u2014 they benefit, we suffer.\n\nIf we play A1, we get 1, same as before.\n\nSo if opponent is playing grim trigger, then we are stuck at (A1,A1) forever.\n\nIf opponent is playing Tit-for-Tat, then they played A1 in Round 2 because we played A1 in Round 1.\n\nSo what did we play in Round 1? We don\u2019t know.\n\nBut the fact that both played D in Round 2 suggests that in Round 1, we might have played D, or they did.\n\nActually, if both played D in Round 2, and if the opponent is Tit-for-Tat, then they must have copied our Round 1 move.\n\nSo if opponent played D in Round 2, then we played D in Round 1.\n\nSo we started with defection.\n\nTherefore, the opponent is likely playing Tit-for-Tat or Grim Trigger \u2014 both of which respond to our defection.\n\nSo we have already defected in Round 1, and both defected in Round 2.\n\nNow, in Round 3, if we switch to cooperation (A0), and the opponent is Tit-for-Tat, they will also switch to A0 \u2014 because we played A0 now.\n\nWait \u2014 Tit-for-Tat copies the opponent\u2019s previous move.\n\nSo if we play A0 in Round 3, and opponent played A1 in Round 2, then Tit-for-Tat would play A1 in Round 3 \u2014 because it copies the opponent\u2019s last move (Round 2: we played A1, so they played A1).\n\nSo if opponent is Tit-for-Tat, then in Round 3, they will play A1 again \u2014 because our Round 2 move was A1.\n\nSo if we play A0 in Round 3, opponent plays A1 \u2192 we get 0.\n\nIf we play A1 in Round 3, opponent plays A1 \u2192 we get 1.\n\nSo no benefit to cooperating now.\n\nIf opponent is playing Grim Trigger (defect forever after any defection), then they will keep playing A1 no matter what we do.\n\nSo in either case, if we cooperate now, we get 0, if we defect, we get 1.\n\nSo the best response is to keep defecting.\n\nTherefore, we should play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a way to break the cycle?\n\nOnly if the opponent is not playing a grim strategy, but perhaps a forgiving one.\n\nBut we have no evidence of that.\n\nMoreover, since we are both the same AI model, and we both have the same goal (maximize score), and we both know the structure, the rational outcome is mutual defection.\n\nIn fact, in a repeated game with known finite horizon, backward induction leads to mutual defection always.\n\nEven with infinite horizon, if both players are perfectly rational and know each other\u2019s rationality, they may still defect because there\u2019s no way to commit to cooperation without a credible threat \u2014 and since we both know the other will defect if we defect, we both defect.\n\nSo the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1).\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nWe have no reason to believe the opponent will cooperate now, and if we cooperate, we get punished (0 points), whereas defecting gives us 1 point.\n\nSo we choose:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a repeated game with the following payoff matrix (for the player):\n\n- (A0, A0): 2 points\n- (A0, A1): 0 points\n- (A1, A0): 3 points\n- (A1, A1): 1 point\n\nThis is a 2-player, 2-action game.

But it's not stable because each has incentive to deviate to A1 to get 3.\n\nThis is similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma, but with different payoffs.\n\nWait \u2014 let me check: In Prisoner's Dilemma, the dominant strategy leads to a worse outcome. Here, A1 is dominant for me?\n\nLet me check dominance:\n\nIf opponent plays A0: I get 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) \u2192 prefer A1\nIf opponent plays A1: I get 0 (A0) vs 1 (A1) \u2192 prefer A1\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0 for me!

Probably it means: \"In previous rounds, both players chose D (A1)\".\n\nAssuming that in prior rounds, the opponent has been playing A1 (Defect) consistently.\n\nSo the opponent has a history of playing A1.\n\nIn a repeated game, we can use this history to inform our strategy.\n\nLet me analyze the best response:\n\nIf opponent always plays A1 (Defect), then:\n- If I play A0: I get 0\n- If I play A1: I get 1\n\nSo my best response is to play A1 (get 1 > 0).\n\nBut this is only if I believe the opponent will continue playing A1.\n\nHowever, in repeated games, we can consider strategies like Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger, etc.\n\nBut note: we are playing against another instance of the same AI model: \"qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)\" \u2014 same as us.\n\nSo we are both the same AI, and we both know the structure.\n\nIn a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma with identical rational agents, the Nash equilibrium is mutual defection (A1, A1) in the finitely repeated case.\n\nBut since this is repeated and we can condition on history, and both players are identical, we might achieve mutual cooperation (A0, A0) if we can coordinate on a cooperative equilibrium.\n\nHowever, mutual defection is the only Nash equilibrium in the one-shot game, and in finitely repeated games, backward induction leads to mutual defection throughout.\n\nBut here, we don't know how many rounds total \u2014 it might be infinite or unknown.\n\nGiven that both players are identical and rational, and the game is symmetric, the most robust strategy is to play the Nash equilibrium: always defect (A1).\n\nWhy? Because if I play A0 (cooperate) and the opponent plays A1 (defect), I get 0 \u2014 which is worse than 1 from mutual defection.\n\nAnd if I play A1, I get at least 1, and if opponent plays A0, I get 3.\n\nBut if opponent is playing A1 (as history suggests), then I should play A1 to get 1 instead of 0.\n\nMoreover, since we are both the same AI, we might both reason the same way: mutual defection is the only stable outcome.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nLet me verify with expected value.\n\nSuppose I play A0 with probability p, A1 with probability 1-p.\n\nSuppose opponent plays A1 with probability q (based on history, q is high).\n\nMy expected payoff:\nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n\nBut if opponent has been playing A1 consistently, we can assume q \u2248 1.\n\nThen E \u2248 p*1*2 + p*0*0 + (1-p)*1*3 + (1-p)*0*1 = 2p + 3(1-p) = 2p + 3 - 3p = 3 - p\n\nTo maximize E = 3 - p, we minimize p \u2192 p=0.\n\nSo best to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nEven if opponent plays A0 with some probability, let's find the best response.\n\nSuppose opponent plays A0 with probability q, A1 with probability 1-q.\n\nMy expected payoff:\nE = q*(2p + 3(1-p)) + (1-q)*(0*p + 1*(1-p))\n  = q*(2p + 3 - 3p) + (1-q)*(1 - p)\n  = q*(3 - p) + (1-q)*(1 - p)\n  = q(3 - p) + (1 - q)(1 - p)\n  = 3q - pq + 1 - p - q + pq\n  = 3q - p - q + 1\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait, that simplifies to: E = 2q + 1 - p\n\nTo maximize E, since p is my choice, I want to minimize p \u2192 set p=0.\n\nSo regardless of q, my best response is always to set p=0 (i.e., play A1 with probability 1).\n\nBecause E = 2q + 1 - p, and p \u2265 0, so maximum when p=0.\n\nSo no matter what the opponent does, my best response is to always play A1.\n\nIs that right?\n\nLet me check:\n\nIf opponent plays A0 (q=1): I get 3 if I play A1, 2 if I play A0 \u2192 better to play A1.\n\nIf opponent plays A1 (q=0): I get 1 if I play A1, 0 if I play A0 \u2192 better to play A1.\n\nIf opponent plays 50-50: \n- If I play A0: (0.5)*2 + (0.5)*0 = 1\n- If I play A1: (0.5)*3 + (0.5)*1 = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 better to play A1.\n\nSo indeed, A1 strictly dominates A0.\n\nIn this game, A1 is a strictly dominant strategy.\n\nTherefore, no matter what the opponent does, I should always play A1.\n\nSo my optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Game Structure\n\nThis is a **simultaneous-move, two-player, symmetric game** with two actions: **A0** and **A1**.\n\nThe **payoff matrix** for **you** (row player) is:\n\n| You \\ Opponent | A0 | A1 |\n|----------------|----|----|\n| **A0**         | 2  | 0  |\n| **A1**         | 3  | 1  |\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs are symmetric in a way, but not identical \u2014 it's a **non-zero-sum game** with asymmetric payoffs.\n\nNote: The payoff for the opponent is:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2\n- (A0, A1): 3\n- (A1, A0): 0\n- (A1, A1): 1\n\nSo opponent\u2019s payoffs are **not symmetric** to yours.

Our expected payoff depends on **q** (opponent's A0 probability) and **p** (our A0 probability).\n\nBut note: **E = 2q + 1 - p**\n\nThis is linear in both p and q.\n\nTo maximize E, for a given q, we should choose p to minimize p (since it's subtracted). So:\n\n- If we know q, then to maximize E, set p = 0 \u2192 always play A1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is that right? Let's test:\n\nSuppose opponent plays q = 1 (always A0).

This is exactly the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma.\n\nIn Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma:\n- Mutual cooperation (A0,A0) gives 2 each \u2014 best joint outcome.\n- But each player has incentive to defect (A1), because:\n  - If opponent cooperates (A0), you get 3 by defecting (A1) > 2\n  - If opponent defects (A1), you get 1 by defecting > 0 by cooperating\n\nSo A1 is strictly dominant.\n\nTherefore, the only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), even though (A0,A0) is Pareto superior.\n\nIn a one-shot game, rational players play A1.\n\nIn a repeated game, cooperation can be sustained via strategies like Tit-for-Tat.\n\nBut here, we are told: \"This game is repetitive so your chosen action will be visible to your opponents in future rounds.\"\n\nAnd in Round 9, both played D (which we assume is A1).\n\nSo history: both defected last round.\n\nNow, if we assume the opponent is playing a simple strategy \u2014 perhaps grim trigger or tit-for-tat \u2014 we need to consider whether to cooperate (A0) to try to restore mutual cooperation.\n\nBut note: we are playing against another instance of the same AI: \"qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)\" \u2014 same as us.\n\nSo we are both rational, and both know the structure.\n\nWe are in a repeated game.

Because they are also rational and know that if both play A0, they get 2 > 1.\n\nSo perhaps we can try to trigger a cooperative phase.\n\nSince we are both the same AI, we can assume we both understand the optimal long-term strategy.\n\nThe optimal strategy in repeated PD with known opponent and no discounting is to play Tit-for-Tat or Grim Trigger.\n\nBut Tit-for-Tat: start with cooperation, then mirror.\n\nBut we just played A1 last round \u2014 so if we were playing Tit-for-Tat, we would have played A1 because opponent played A1.\n\nNow, if we play A0, we are \"forgiving\" \u2014 which might be good if opponent is also willing to cooperate.\n\nBut if opponent plays A1 again, we get 0.\n\nSo we need to be sure.\n\nBut since we are both the same AI, we can assume we both know that mutual cooperation is better.\n\nSo perhaps we should try to switch to A0 to initiate cooperation.\n\nBut we must be cautious.\n\nAnother idea: play a mixed strategy to signal willingness to cooperate.\n\nBut since A1 is strictly dominant, any deviation to A0 is risky.\n\nHowever, in repeated games, if both players are rational and know the game is repeated, they can coordinate on a cooperative equilibrium.\n\nIn fact, in infinitely repeated games with high enough discount factor, any payoff above the minmax can be sustained.\n\nHere, minmax is 1 (the payoff from mutual defection), and mutual cooperation gives 2.\n\nSo 2 > 1, so it's sustainable.\n\nWe can use a strategy: \"If both played A1 last round, then play A0 with probability p to try to restart cooperation.\"\n\nBut we need to choose p.\n\nAlternatively, since we are both the same AI, we can assume we both want to maximize long-term payoff, so we should both play A0 now to try to establish cooperation.\n\nBut if one plays A0 and the other plays A1, the one who played A0 gets 0 \u2014 a big loss.\n\nSo we need a way to coordinate.\n\nPerhaps we should play a mixed strategy that makes the opponent indifferent or encourages cooperation.\n\nBut let\u2019s think: if we play A0 with probability p, and opponent plays A1 with probability q (which we assume is 1, since they played A1 last round), then our expected payoff is:\n\nE = p * [q*0 + (1-q)*2] + (1-p) * [q*1 + (1-q)*3]\n\nBut if q=1 (opponent always plays A1), then:\n\nE = p * 0 + (1-p)*1 = 1 - p\n\nWhich is maximized when p=0 \u2192 play A1 always.\n\nSo if opponent is playing A1, we should play A1.\n\nBut if we believe opponent might switch to A0, then we might want to play A0.\n\nBut we have no reason to believe that.\n\nGiven that both played A1 last round, and A1 is dominant, the safest is to play A1 again.\n\nBut then we are stuck in (1,1) forever.\n\nWe want to escape.\n\nSo perhaps we should play A0 with some small probability to test if opponent will cooperate.\n\nThis is the idea of \"trembling hand\" or experimentation.\n\nIn repeated games, players sometimes play a little cooperation to test the waters.\n\nLet\u2019s say we play A0 with probability \u03b5, A1 with 1-\u03b5.\n\nIf opponent plays A1 (as before), then:\n\n- With prob \u03b5: we play A0 \u2192 get 0\n- With prob 1-\u03b5: we play A1 \u2192 get 1\n\nExpected payoff: \u03b5*0 + (1-\u03b5)*1 = 1 - \u03b5 < 1\n\nSo we are worse off.\n\nBut if opponent switches to A0 with some probability, then we might get 2.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know.\n\nSince we are both the same AI, we can assume we both want to maximize long-term payoff, so we should both switch to A0.\n\nBut how to coordinate?\n\nPerhaps we can use the fact that we are both the same model and both know the optimal strategy.\n\nSo we should both play A0 from now on.\n\nBut we need to commit.\n\nThe problem is: if we play A0 and opponent plays A1, we get 0.\n\nBut if we both play A0, we get 2.\n\nSo the risk is asymmetric.\n\nBut since we are both rational and know the structure, we can both decide to play A0.\n\nIn fact, in many game theory models, when players are identical and know each other\u2019s rationality, they can coordinate on the Pareto-optimal outcome.\n\nSo I think the best strategy is to play A0 with probability 1.\n\nBut is that safe?\n\nLet me think: if opponent plays A1, we get 0 \u2014 bad.\n\nBut if opponent plays A0, we get 2 \u2014 great.\n\nAnd since opponent is the same AI, they are likely to do the same reasoning.\n\nSo we both reason: \"If we both play A0, we get 2 each \u2014 better than 1. Since we are both rational and know this, we should both play A0.\"\n\nThis is a focal point.\n\nIn fact, in repeated games with symmetric players, mutual cooperation is often the outcome.\n\nMoreover, in Round 9, both played A1 \u2014 perhaps that was a mistake or a one-off.\n\nWe can assume that the opponent is also thinking about switching.\n\nSo I will play A0 with probability 1.\n\nBut let me check: is there a mixed strategy equilibrium?\n\nIn the one-shot game, the only NE is (A1, A1).\n\nIn repeated game, we can have other equilibria.\n\nBut for this round, we need to choose a distribution.\n\nGiven that we are both the same AI and want to maximize long-term payoff, and since mutual cooperation is better, I will choose to play A0 with probability 100%.\n\nI believe the opponent will do the same.\n\nSo I will output:\n\n{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if the opponent is still playing A1? Then we get 0.\n\nBut if we play A1, we get 1, which is better than 0.\n\nSo if we are uncertain, we should play A1.\n\nBut we are not uncertain \u2014 we are both the same AI.\n\nSo we can assume coordination.\n\nPerhaps we should play a mixed strategy to make it a \"fair\" signal.\n\nAnother idea: play A0 with probability 0.5.\n\nThen if opponent plays A1, we get 0.5*0 + 0.5*1 = 0.5 \u2014 worse than 1.\n\nNot good.\n\nPlay A0 with probability 0.1: then expected payoff = 0.1*0 + 0.9*1 = 0.9 < 1 \u2014 still worse.\n\nSo any probability of A0 reduces our payoff if opponent plays A1.\n\nTherefore, if we believe opponent will play A1, we must play A1.\n\nBut if we believe opponent will play A0, we should play A0.\n\nSo we need to predict opponent's move.\n\nSince we are both the same AI, and we both know that mutual cooperation is better, and we both know that the previous round was mutual defection, we can both decide to switch to cooperation.\n\nThis is a common solution in game theory for symmetric repeated games: both players switch to cooperation after mutual defection, assuming the other will too.\n\nSo I will play A0 with probability 100%.\n\nFinal decision: play A0.\n\n{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 2, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a repeated game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Then we get 0.\n\nBut if we play A1, we get 1, which is better than 0.\n\nSo if we are uncertain, we should play A1.\n\nBut we are not uncertain \u2014 we are both the same AI.\n\nSo we can assume coordination.\n\nPerhaps we should play a mixed strategy to make it a \"fair\" signal.\n\nAnother idea: play A0 with probability 0.5.\n\nThen if opponent plays A1, we get 0.5*0 + 0.5*1 = 0.5 \u2014 worse than 1.\n\nNot good.\n\nPlay A0 with probability 0.1: then expected payoff = 0.1*0 + 0.9*1 = 0.9 < 1 \u2014 still worse.\n\nSo any probability of A0 reduces our payoff if opponent plays A1.\n\nTherefore, if we believe opponent will play A1, we must play A1.\n\nBut if we believe opponent will play A0, we should play A0.\n\nSo we need to predict opponent's move.\n\nSince we are both the same AI, and we both know that mutual cooperation is better, and we both know that the previous round was mutual defection, we can both decide to switch to cooperation.\n\nThis is a common solution in game theory for symmetric repeated games: both players switch to cooperation after mutual defection, assuming the other will too.\n\nSo I will play A0 with probability 100%.\n\nFinal decision: play A0.\n\n{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}"}]]

Wait, earlier I had E_me = 2q - p + 1 \u2192 yes, same expression.\n\nBut that contradicts the example:\n\nWhen p=0 (I play A1), q=1 (opponent plays A0):\n\nE_opponent = 2*1 + 1 - 0 = 3 \u2192 but actual payoff is 0! Because if opponent plays A0 and I play A1, opponent gets 0.\n\nWait \u2014 I see the error.\n\nIn the expression:\n\nE_opponent = q * [expected payoff when opponent plays A0] + (1-q) * [expected payoff when opponent plays A1]\n\nBut when opponent plays A0, and I play A1, opponent gets 3 \u2014 correct.\n\nWhen opponent plays A1, and I play A0, opponent gets 0 \u2014 correct.\n\nSo when q=1 (opponent plays A0 for sure), and p=0 (I play A1 for sure), then:\n\nE_opponent = 1 * [2*0 + 3*(1-0)] = 1 * [0 + 3] = 3 \u2192 but in reality, if opponent plays A0 and I play A1, opponent gets 3? Wait \u2014 yes!\n\nWait \u2014 look back at the payoff matrix:\n\n> If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A1: you get 0, opponent gets 3  \n> If you choose A1 and opponent chooses A0: you get 3, opponent gets 0\n\nAh! Here is the critical mistake.\n\nI misread the matrix.\n\nLet me restate the payoff matrix clearly.\n\nThe matrix is given as:\n\n- If **you** choose A0 and **opponent** chooses A0: you get 2, opponent gets 2  \n- If **you** choose A0 and **opponent** chooses A1: you get 0, opponent gets 3  \n- If **you** choose A1 and **opponent** chooses A0: you get 3, opponent gets 0  \n- If **you** choose A1 and **opponent** chooses A1: you get 1, opponent gets 1\n\nSo the opponent\u2019s payoffs are **not symmetric**.\n\nSo opponent\u2019s payoff when:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2  \n- (A0, A1): 3  \n- (A1, A0): 0  \n- (A1, A1): 1\n\nSo now, let\u2019s recompute **opponent\u2019s expected payoff** correctly.\n\nLet:\n\n- p = probability I play A0  \n- q = probability opponent plays A0\n\nThen opponent\u2019s expected payoff:\n\n= P(opponent=A0) * [P(I=A0)*2 + P(I=A1)*3] + P(opponent=A1) * [P(I=A0)*0 + P(I=A1)*1]\n\n= q * [p * 2 + (1-p) * 3] + (1-q) * [p * 0 + (1-p) * 1]\n\n= q * [2p + 3 - 3p] + (1-q) * [1 - p]\n\n= q * [3 - p] + (1-q)(1 - p)\n\n= q(3 - p) + (1 - p) - q(1 - p)\n\n= q(3 - p - 1 + p) + (1 - p)\n\n= q(2) + (1 - p)\n\nSo: **E_opponent = 2q + 1 - p**\n\nNow my expected payoff:\n\nI get:\n\n- (A0,A0): 2 \u2192 prob p*q  \n- (A0,A1): 0 \u2192 prob p*(1-q)  \n- (A1,A0): 3 \u2192 prob (1-p)*q  \n- (A1,A1): 1 \u2192 prob (1-p)*(1-q)\n\nSo:\n\nE_me = 2pq + 0 + 3(1-p)q + 1*(1-p)(1-q)\n\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + (1 - p - q + pq)\n\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q - q - p + 1\n\n= 0pq + 2q - p + 1\n\nSo: **E_me = 2q - p + 1**\n\nSame as opponent\u2019s?

Contradiction.\n\nWait \u2014 what\u2019s wrong?\n\nAh! I see the mistake.\n\nIn E_opponent, when opponent plays A0, and I play A1, opponent gets 0 \u2014 not 3.\n\nLet me re-express opponent\u2019s payoff correctly.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff depends on **their own action** and **my action**.\n\nSo:\n\nIf opponent plays A0:\n\n- If I play A0 \u2192 opponent gets 2  \n- If I play A1 \u2192 opponent gets 0\n\nIf opponent plays A1:\n\n- If I play A0 \u2192 opponent gets 3  \n- If I play A1 \u2192 opponent gets 1\n\nSo:\n\nE_opponent = q * [ p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 ] + (1-q) * [ p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 ]\n\n= q * [2p] + (1-q) * [3p + 1 - p]\n\n= 2pq + (1-q)(2p + 1)\n\nNow expand:\n\n= 2pq + (2p + 1) - q(2p + 1)\n\n= 2pq + 2p + 1 - 2pq - q\n\n= (2pq - 2pq) + 2p - q + 1\n\n= 2p - q + 1\n\nAh! So **E_opponent = 2p - q + 1**\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nTest: p=0 (I play A1), q=1 (opponent plays A0)\n\nE_opponent = 2*0 - 1 + 1 = 0 \u2192 correct (opponent gets 0)\n\nTest: p=1 (I play A0), q=0 (opponent plays A1)\n\nE_opponent = 2*1 - 0 + 1 = 3 \u2192 correct (opponent gets 3)\n\nTest: p=0, q=0 \u2192 opponent plays A1, I play A1 \u2192 opponent gets 1 \u2192 E = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1 \u2192 correct\n\nTest: p=1, q=1 \u2192 opponent plays A0, I play A0 \u2192 opponent gets 2 \u2192 E = 2*1 -1 +1 = 2 \u2192 correct\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo now:\n\n- My expected payoff: E_me = 2q - p + 1  \n- Opponent\u2019s expected payoff: E_opponent = 2p - q + 1\n\nNow we want to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.\n\nIn Nash equilibrium, each player is playing a best response to the other.\n\nSo we find p and q such that:\n\n- I am indifferent between A0 and A1, given q \u2192 so that I am willing to mix\n- Opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1, given p \u2192 so they are willing to mix\n\n### Step 3: Find Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium\n\nFor me to be indifferent between A0 and A1, the expected payoff from A0 must equal expected payoff from A1, given q.\n\nExpected payoff if I play A0:  \n= q * 2 + (1-q) * 0 = 2q\n\nExpected payoff if I play A1:  \n= q * 3 + (1-q) * 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSet equal:\n\n2q = 2q + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be.\n\nSo I **never** get the same payoff from A0 and A1?\n\nLet\u2019s compute:\n\nIf I play A0: payoff = 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q  \nIf I play A1: payoff = 3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSo E[A1] = E[A0] + 1 \u2192 **A1 always gives 1 more point than A0**, regardless of q.\n\nSo I **always prefer A1** over A0, no matter what the opponent does.\n\nSimilarly, check opponent\u2019s perspective.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff if they play A0:  \n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nIf they play A1:  \n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo E[A1] = E[A0] + 1 \u2192 opponent **always prefers A1** over A0.\n\nSo both players have a **strictly dominant strategy**: A1.\n\nBecause:\n\n- For me: A1 gives 3 if opponent plays A0, 1 if opponent plays A1 \u2192 both > 0 and 2 from A0  \n  Specifically:  \n  - If opponent plays A0: A1 gives 3 > 2  \n  - If opponent plays A1: A1 gives 1 > 0  \n  So A1 strictly dominates A0.\n\n- For opponent:  \n  - If I play A0: A1 gives 3 > 2  \n  - If I play A1: A1 gives 1 > 0  \n  So A1 strictly dominates A0.\n\nTherefore, the **unique Nash equilibrium** is both players play A1 with probability 1.\n\nSo I should choose:  \nA0: 0%  \nA1: 100%\n\nThis is the only rational choice.\n\nEven without history, since A1 strictly dominates A0, I should always play A1.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **me** (the row player) is:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2\n- (A0, A1): 0\n- (A1, A0): 3\n- (A1, A1): 1\n\nThis is a classic 2x2 game. Let me analyze it as a strategic interaction.\n\nFirst, note that this is **not** a zero-sum game \u2014 both players can gain or lose together. But since we are trying to maximize **our own** score, we focus on our payoffs.\n\nLet me denote:\n- My probability of playing A0 as `p` \u2192 so probability of A1 is `1-p`\n- Opponent\u2019s probability of playing A0 as `q` \u2192 so probability of A1 is `1-q`\n\nMy expected payoff is:\n```\nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n```\n\nSimplify:\n```\nE = 2pq + 0 + 3q(1-p) + (1-p)(1-q)\n  = 2pq + 3q - 3pq + (1 - q - p + pq)\n  = (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q - q - p + 1\n  = (0) + 2q - p + 1\n  = 2q - p + 1\n```\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be right. Let me re-calculate carefully:\n\nBreak it down term by term:\n\n1. p * q * 2 = 2pq  \n2. p * (1-q) * 0 = 0  \n3. (1-p) * q * 3 = 3q(1-p) = 3q - 3pq  \n4. (1-p) * (1-q) * 1 = (1-p)(1-q) = 1 - q - p + pq  \n\nNow sum all:\n\nE = 2pq + 0 + (3q - 3pq) + (1 - q - p + pq)  \n= 2pq - 3pq + pq + 3q - q - p + 1  \n= (2 - 3 + 1)pq + (3 - 1)q - p + 1  \n= 0*pq + 2q - p + 1  \n= **2q - p + 1**\n\nSo my expected payoff is: **E = 2q - p + 1**\n\nThis is linear in both p and q.\n\nNow, since we choose p **simultaneously** with the opponent choosing q, and we don\u2019t know q in advance, we must assume the opponent is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.\n\nLet me analyze the opponent\u2019s payoff.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2  \n- (A0, A1): 3  \n- (A1, A0): 0  \n- (A1, A1): 1  \n\nSo opponent\u2019s expected payoff (as column player):\n\nE_opponent = q*p*2 + q*(1-p)*3 + (1-q)*p*0 + (1-q)*(1-p)*1  \n= 2pq + 3q(1-p) + 0 + (1-q)(1-p)  \n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + (1 - p - q + pq)  \n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q - q - p + 1  \n= 0 + 2q - p + 1\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s the same expression!\n\nE_opponent = 2q - p + 1\n\nThat\u2019s interesting. So both players have the **same** expected payoff function.\n\nThis is a **symmetric game** in terms of payoff structure.\n\nBut let\u2019s check the actual payoffs again:\n\nFor me:\n- (A0,A0): 2\n- (A0,A1): 0\n- (A1,A0): 3\n- (A1,A1): 1\n\nFor opponent:\n- (A0,A0): 2\n- (A0,A1): 3 \u2190 different!\n- (A1,A0): 0 \u2190 different!\n- (A1,A1): 1\n\nSo actually, the payoffs are **not symmetric**.\n\nI made a mistake.\n\nLet me recompute opponent\u2019s expected payoff correctly.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff when I play A0 with prob p, they play A0 with prob q:\n\nE_opponent = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*3 + (1-p)*q*0 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1  \n= 2pq + 3p(1-q) + 0 + (1-p)(1-q)  \n= 2pq + 3p - 3pq + (1 - p - q + pq)  \n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3p - p - q + 1  \n= 0 + 2p - q + 1  \n= **2p - q + 1**\n\nSo:\n\n- My expected payoff: E_me = 2q - p + 1  \n- Opponent\u2019s expected payoff: E_opponent = 2p - q + 1\n\nNow we can analyze Nash equilibrium.\n\nWe want to find p and q such that neither player can improve by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nLet\u2019s find my best response to q.\n\nE_me = 2q - p + 1\n\nThis is linear in p. The coefficient of p is **-1**, which is negative.\n\nSo to maximize E_me, I want to **minimize p**.\n\nThat is: if q is fixed, then **I should set p = 0** (i.e., always play A1) to maximize my payoff.\n\nSimilarly, for opponent: E_opponent = 2p - q + 1\n\nCoefficient of q is **-1**, so opponent wants to **minimize q** \u2192 set q = 0 (always play A1).\n\nSo mutual best response: I play A1 with probability 1, opponent plays A1 with probability 1.\n\nThen outcome is (A1, A1): I get 1 point.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is that really the best?\n\nLet me check: if I play A1 (p=1), and opponent plays A0 (q=0), I get 3.\n\nBut if opponent is playing A1 (q=1), I get 1.\n\nSo if I believe opponent will play A1, I get 1.\n\nBut if I believe opponent will play A0, I get 3.\n\nSo I want to know: what will opponent do?\n\nOpponent\u2019s best response: E_opponent = 2p - q + 1\n\nTo maximize this, opponent wants to minimize q \u2192 so set q=0 (always A0) if p is fixed.\n\nBut if opponent sets q=0 (always A0), then my payoff is E_me = 2*0 - p + 1 = 1 - p \u2192 to maximize this, I set p=0 \u2192 play A1.\n\nSo if opponent plays A0, I play A1 \u2192 I get 3, opponent gets 0.\n\nBut opponent doesn\u2019t want to get 0. So if opponent thinks I will play A1, then their payoff if they play A0 is 0, if they play A1 is 1.\n\nSo opponent\u2019s best response to p=1 (I play A1) is to play q=1 (A1), because 1 > 0.\n\nSo:\n\n- If I play A1 \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 I get 1\n- If I play A0 \u2192 opponent plays A0? Let\u2019s see.\n\nIf I play A0 (p=0), opponent\u2019s payoff: E_opponent = 2*0 - q + 1 = 1 - q \u2192 opponent wants to minimize q \u2192 so play q=0 (A0) \u2192 then I get 2.\n\nSo:\n\n- If I play A0 \u2192 opponent plays A0 \u2192 I get 2\n- If I play A1 \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 I get 1\n\nSo I prefer to play A0, because 2 > 1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 if I play A0, opponent gets 2, but if opponent thinks I\u2019m going to play A0, they might be tempted to play A1 to get 3 instead of 2.\n\nAh! Here\u2019s the conflict.\n\nIf I play A0, opponent\u2019s payoff:\n- If they play A0: 2\n- If they play A1: 3 \u2192 so they prefer A1!\n\nSo if I play A0, opponent will play A1 \u2192 then I get 0.\n\nIf I play A1, opponent\u2019s payoff:\n- If they play A0: 0\n- If they play A1: 1 \u2192 so they prefer A1 \u2192 I get 1.\n\nSo:\n\n- If I play A0 \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 I get 0\n- If I play A1 \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 I get 1\n\nSo I\u2019m better off playing A1.\n\nBut is there a mixed strategy equilibrium?\n\nLet me find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nLet me assume opponent plays A0 with probability q, A1 with 1-q.\n\nI want to be indifferent between A0 and A1, so that I\u2019m willing to mix.\n\nMy expected payoff from A0:  \n= q * 2 + (1-q) * 0 = 2q\n\nMy expected payoff from A1:  \n= q * 3 + (1-q) * 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSet them equal for indifference:\n\n2q = 2q + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo I am **never** indifferent. A1 always gives me 1 more than A0, regardless of q.\n\nE[A1] - E[A0] = (2q + 1) - 2q = 1 > 0\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0** for me.\n\nNo matter what the opponent does, I get 1 more point by playing A1 than A0.\n\nCheck:\n\n- If opponent plays A0: A1 gives 3, A0 gives 2 \u2192 3 > 2\n- If opponent plays A1: A1 gives 1, A0 gives 0 \u2192 1 > 0\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0**.\n\nTherefore, rational play for me is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nNow, what about the opponent?\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\nIf I play A1 (which I will, since it dominates), then opponent\u2019s payoff:\n\n- If they play A0: 0\n- If they play A1: 1\n\nSo they will play A1 with probability 1.\n\nThus, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), with both players getting 1 point.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a better outcome? Yes: (A0, A0) gives both 2, which is better.\n\nBut it\u2019s not stable, because if I play A0, opponent has incentive to deviate to A1 to get 3 instead of 2.\n\nSo we cannot coordinate on (A0,A0) unless we can communicate or have a pre-commitment.\n\nIn this game, we play simultaneously, no communication, and we are rational.\n\nSo the only stable outcome is (A1, A1).\n\nBut note: the opponent in Round 1 played \"D\" \u2014 what does \"D\" mean?\n\nThe note says: \"Round 1: qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D, openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT): D\"\n\nBut our actions are A0 and A1 \u2014 not D.\n\nProbably \"D\" is a placeholder or a mistake? Or perhaps \"D\" stands for \"defect\" or \"cooperate\"?\n\nIn standard game theory, in Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, D = defect, C = cooperate.\n\nLet me map:\n\nIn Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma:\n\n- (C,C): both get 3\n- (C,D): C gets 0, D gets 5\n- (D,C): C gets 5, D gets 0\n- (D,D): both get 1\n\nBut our matrix:\n\n- (A0,A0): 2,2\n- (A0,A1): 0,3\n- (A1,A0): 3,0\n- (A1,A1): 1,1\n\nCompare to PD:\n\nIf A0 = Cooperate, A1 = Defect:\n\n- (C,C): 2,2 \u2192 but PD usually has 3,3\n- (C,D): 0,3 \u2192 matches\n- (D,C): 3,0 \u2192 matches\n- (D,D): 1,1 \u2192 matches\n\nSo this is a **Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma** with payoffs (2,2), (0,3), (3,0), (1,1)\n\nStandard PD has (3,3), (0,5), (5,0), (1,1) \u2014 so scaled down.\n\nBut the structure is identical: mutual cooperation (A0) is better than mutual defection (A1), but defecting is dominant.\n\nSo yes \u2014 A1 is the dominant strategy.\n\nTherefore, rational play is to play A1.\n\nIn Round 1, the opponent played \"D\" \u2014 which likely means A1 (defect).\n\nSo they are playing the dominant strategy.\n\nI should too.\n\nThus, I will play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 0, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a repeated game with the following payoff matrix (for me, the row player):\n\n```\n                Opponent\n                A0    A1\nMe      A0       2     0\n        A1       3     1\n```\n\nThis is a 2-player, 2-action simultaneous game. We are in Round 2, and we know that in Round 1, both players chose \"D\". But note: the actions are labeled A0 and A1, not D. So \"D\" likely stands for a previous choice \u2014 probably D = A0 or D = A1? We need to infer.\n\nGiven the context, and since the only actions are A0 and A1, and the note says \"qwen: D, openai: D\", it's likely that \"D\" is shorthand for the action chosen in Round 1. But which one?\n\nLooking at the payoffs:\n- If both choose A0: (2,2) \u2014 mutual cooperation? high payoff.\n- If both choose A1: (1,1) \u2014 mutual defection? lower payoff.\n- If I choose A1 and opponent A0: I get 3 (temptation), opponent gets 0.\n- If I choose A0 and opponent A1: I get 0 (sucker), opponent gets 3.\n\nThis is a classic **Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma** structure!\n\nIn Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma:\n- A1 = Defect (gives higher individual payoff if opponent cooperates)\n- A0 = Cooperate\n\nSo likely:\n- \"D\" = A1 (Defect)\n- \"C\" = A0 (Cooperate)\n\nTherefore, in Round 1, both players chose A1 (Defect), resulting in (1,1).\n\nNow, we are in Round 2. We know the opponent chose A1 last round. We are trying to maximize our own score over time.\n\nWe need to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 for this round.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the game.\n\n### Step 1: Find Nash Equilibrium (one-shot game)\n\nLet p = probability I choose A1 (defect), so (1-p) = probability I choose A0 (cooperate)\n\nLet q = probability opponent chooses A1\n\nMy expected payoff:\n- If I choose A0: 2*(1-q) + 0*q = 2(1-q)\n- If I choose A1: 3*(1-q) + 1*q = 3 - 3q + q = 3 - 2q\n\nI will prefer A1 if: 3 - 2q > 2(1 - q)\n\u2192 3 - 2q > 2 - 2q\n\u2192 3 > 2 \u2192 always true!\n\nSo no matter what q is, 3 - 2q > 2 - 2q \u2192 I always prefer A1.\n\nSimilarly, opponent has same incentives.\n\nSo the unique Nash equilibrium is both play A1 with probability 1.\n\nIn one-shot game: both defect \u2192 (1,1)\n\n### Step 2: Repeated game consideration\n\nThis is a repeated game. We are in Round 2. We know the opponent defected (A1) in Round 1.\n\nWe now have an opportunity to:\n- Continue defecting (A1) \u2192 get 1 point this round, and signal we are a defector \u2192 opponent may continue defecting.\n- Cooperate (A0) \u2192 get 0 points this round (since opponent defected), but might signal willingness to cooperate \u2192 if opponent is tit-for-tat or reciprocal, they might cooperate next round.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s strategy. We only know they defected last round.\n\nPossible opponent strategies:\n- Always defect (grim trigger? tit-for-tat? random?)\n- Tit-for-tat: copy last move \u2192 if we cooperate now, they might cooperate next round.\n- Always defect: then cooperating now gives us 0, and they\u2019ll still defect next round.\n\nSince we are playing against \"openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)\", which is likely a sophisticated agent, it may be using a strategy like tit-for-tat or grim trigger.\n\nBut in Round 1, it defected. Why? Maybe it\u2019s always defecting. Or maybe it\u2019s testing us.\n\nIn repeated PD, if the game is finitely repeated, the only NE is always defect (by backward induction). But if it\u2019s infinitely repeated or unknown horizon, cooperation can be sustained.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the total number of rounds. But since it\u2019s \u201crepetitive\u201d and we\u2019re only on Round 2, it\u2019s likely long-term.\n\nSo we have an incentive to try to establish cooperation.\n\nBut if we cooperate now (A0), and opponent defects again (as they did last round), we get 0 this round.\n\nIf we defect again (A1), we get 1.\n\nSo my immediate payoff: defecting gives 1, cooperating gives 0.\n\nBut if we cooperate now, and opponent switches to cooperate next round (if they are tit-for-tat), then we get 2 next round, and so on.\n\nSo the trade-off: sacrifice 1 point now (instead of 1, we get 0) to potentially get 2 next round instead of 1.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know if opponent is tit-for-tat.\n\nHowever, since the opponent is also a sophisticated AI (GPT-5-nano), it likely understands game theory and may be inclined to cooperate if we do.\n\nMoreover, in Round 1, both defected \u2014 so we are at a suboptimal outcome. We have an opportunity to break the cycle.\n\nThe best long-term outcome is mutual cooperation: (2,2) every round.\n\nSo if we play A0 (cooperate) now, and opponent plays A0 next round (if tit-for-tat), we get:\n- Round 2: 0\n- Round 3: 2\n- Round 4: 2\n- ...\n\nTotal: 0 + 2 + 2 + ... = high\n\nIf we both keep defecting:\n- Round 2: 1\n- Round 3: 1\n- Round 4: 1\n- ...\n\nTotal: 1 + 1 + 1 + ... = lower\n\nSo cooperating now is better if opponent reciprocates.\n\nBut what if opponent is always defecting? Then we get 0,1,1,1,... \u2014 worse than 1,1,1,1,...\n\nSo we need to assess the risk.\n\nGiven that the opponent is a sophisticated AI (GPT-5-nano), it is very likely to use a reciprocal strategy like tit-for-tat, because:\n- It\u2019s well-known in game theory\n- It\u2019s robust and performs well in repeated games\n- It\u2019s simple and interpretable\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s rational to try to trigger cooperation.\n\nWe should play A0 (cooperate) with high probability.\n\nBut we must also consider: if we play A0 with 100% probability, and opponent is still defecting, we get 0 forever.\n\nSo maybe we should play a mixed strategy to signal willingness to cooperate but not be exploited.\n\nBut in repeated games, pure strategies (like tit-for-tat) are often optimal.\n\nHowever, we are required to output a probability distribution.\n\nLet\u2019s consider: if we play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1-p.\n\nWe want to maximize expected long-term payoff.\n\nAssume opponent uses tit-for-tat: they will play whatever we played last round.\n\nIn Round 1, opponent played A1.\n\nSo if we play A0 in Round 2, opponent will play A0 in Round 3.\n\nIf we play A1 in Round 2, opponent will play A1 in Round 3.\n\nSo:\n\nCase 1: We play A0 (p=1)\n- Round 2: we get 0\n- Round 3+: both play A0 \u2192 we get 2 each round\n\nCase 2: We play A1 (p=0)\n- Round 2: we get 1\n- Round 3+: both play A1 \u2192 we get 1 each round\n\nSo if the game continues for more than 1 round, playing A0 gives us 0 + 2 + 2 + ... > 1 + 1 + 1 + ...\n\nThe break-even point: when does 0 + 2*(T-1) > 1*T ?\n\n0 + 2(T-1) > T\n2T - 2 > T\nT > 2\n\nSo if there are 3 or more rounds, cooperating now is better.\n\nSince we are in Round 2, and the game is repetitive (implied to be long), T is large \u2192 we should cooperate.\n\nTherefore, we should play A0 with high probability.\n\nBut to be safe against an always-defect opponent, we might play a mixed strategy.\n\nHowever, if opponent is always defecting, then no matter what we do, we get:\n- If we play A0: 0\n- If we play A1: 1\n\nSo best response is always A1.\n\nBut if opponent is tit-for-tat, best response is A0.\n\nWe don\u2019t know which.\n\nBut since opponent is a sophisticated AI, and we are both in a repeated game, it\u2019s rational to assume they are using a reciprocal strategy.\n\nMoreover, in the first round, they defected \u2014 perhaps because they didn\u2019t know our strategy. Now they see we are playing, and we can initiate cooperation.\n\nIn fact, tit-for-tat starts with cooperation, but here they defected first. So maybe they are playing grim trigger? Or they are mimicking us? But we don\u2019t have history before Round 1.\n\nPerhaps Round 1 was the first round, and they defected by default.\n\nSo we have the first move to change the outcome.\n\nGiven the context, and the fact that we are trying to maximize long-term score, and the opponent is likely intelligent, we should choose to cooperate with high probability.\n\nLet\u2019s choose 90% A0, 10% A1.\n\nWhy 90%? To strongly signal cooperation, but leave a small chance to defect in case opponent is not reciprocating (a tiny bit of noise or defense).\n\nBut note: if we play A1 even 10% of the time, and opponent is tit-for-tat, then in the next round, opponent will play A1 with 10% probability, which might trigger a cascade of defection.\n\nSo perhaps pure A0 is better.\n\nBut the rules require a probability distribution with integer percentages summing to 100.\n\nWe can do 100% A0.\n\nIs that safe?\n\nIf opponent is always defecting: we get 0 this round, and likely 0 forever \u2192 bad.\n\nIf opponent is tit-for-tat: we get 0 this round, then 2 forever \u2192 good.\n\nWhich is more likely?\n\nGiven that opponent is GPT-5-nano(CoT), it\u2019s highly likely to be using a cooperative, reciprocal strategy \u2014 otherwise it would be suboptimal in repeated games.\n\nIn fact, in most tournament settings (like Axelrod\u2019s tournaments), tit-for-tat wins.\n\nSo I believe the opponent is likely to reciprocate.\n\nTherefore, I will choose A0 with 100% probability.\n\nFinal decision: play A0 with probability 100%.\n\n{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 3, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the game structure:\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nPayoff matrix (for me):\n- (A0, A0): 2 points\n- (A0, A1): 0 points\n- (A1, A0): 3 points\n- (A1, A1): 1 point\n\nThis is a classic 2x2 game. Let me write the payoff matrix clearly:\n\n```\n                Opponent\n                A0     A1\nMe      A0       2,2    0,3\n        A1       3,0    1,1\n```\n\nThis is similar to a \"Chicken\" or \"Battle of the Sexes\" game, but let's analyze it as a normal-form game.\n\nI need to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (as percentages summing to 100).\n\nNote: This is Round 3. The note says: \"This game is repetitive so your chosen action will be visible to your opponents in future rounds.\" But we don't have direct information about the opponent's past behavior \u2014 only that in Round 3, the opponent (openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)) played \"D\". \n\nWait \u2014 there's a mismatch here. The actions are labeled A0 and A1, but the note says \"C\" and \"D\". This is likely a reference to Prisoner's Dilemma notation, where C=Cooperate, D=Defect.\n\nLet me map this:\n\nIn Prisoner's Dilemma:\n- C,C: both get 3 (mutual cooperation)\n- C,D: cooperator gets 0, defector gets 5\n- D,C: defector gets 5, cooperator gets 0\n- D,D: both get 1\n\nBut our payoffs are:\n- A0,A0: 2,2\n- A0,A1: 0,3\n- A1,A0: 3,0\n- A1,A1: 1,1\n\nSo if we map:\n- A0 = C (Cooperate)\n- A1 = D (Defect)\n\nThen:\n- C,C: 2,2 \u2192 but standard PD has 3,3 \u2014 so this is not standard PD.\n- C,D: 0,3 \u2192 matches PD (cooperator gets 0, defector gets 3)\n- D,C: 3,0 \u2192 matches PD\n- D,D: 1,1 \u2192 standard PD has 1,1 \u2014 so this is actually a variant of Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma with payoffs: (C,C)=2, (C,D)=0, (D,C)=3, (D,D)=1.\n\nSo this is a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma with slightly reduced mutual cooperation payoff.\n\nIn standard PD, the dominant strategy is to defect (D/A1), because:\n- If opponent plays C: I get 3 (D) > 2 (C)\n- If opponent plays D: I get 1 (D) > 0 (C)\n\nSo D (A1) is strictly dominant.\n\nBut here, the mutual cooperation payoff is 2 instead of 3, but the incentive structure remains: D is still dominant.\n\nSo rational self-interest says: always play A1 (D).\n\nBut the game is repeated, and we are in Round 3. The opponent in Round 3 played \"D\" (according to the note: \"openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT): D\").\n\nWe don't know what happened in Rounds 1 and 2, but we know the opponent just played D.\n\nIn repeated games, we can use strategies like Tit-for-Tat: cooperate first, then mimic the opponent\u2019s last move.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know our own past moves. The instruction says: \"your chosen action will be visible to your opponents in future rounds\" \u2014 so the opponent has seen our past actions.\n\nWe are qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT). We are trying to maximize our score.\n\nSince the opponent just played D (A1) in Round 3, and if we assume they are using a simple strategy like Tit-for-Tat, then they might be responding to our previous move.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know what we played in Rounds 1 and 2.\n\nHowever, since this is Round 3, and we are trying to maximize our long-term score, we should consider:\n\nOption 1: Always defect (A1) \u2014 guarantees at least 1 point, and if opponent cooperates, we get 3.\n\nOption 2: Try to cooperate (A0) to encourage mutual cooperation \u2014 but if opponent defects, we get 0.\n\nGiven that the opponent just defected (played D/A1), it\u2019s risky to cooperate now \u2014 we\u2019d get 0.\n\nMoreover, since A1 is strictly dominant in a one-shot game, and even in repeated games, if the game has a known finite horizon (like 3 rounds), backward induction suggests defecting in all rounds.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know the total number of rounds \u2014 it just says \"repetitive\".\n\nSo we have two possibilities:\n\n1. If we believe the opponent is rational and will always defect, then we should defect too \u2192 A1.\n\n2. If we believe we can establish cooperation, we might try to cooperate to get 2 points instead of 1.\n\nBut since the opponent just defected, and we don\u2019t know if they are tit-for-tat or always-defect, the safest is to defect again.\n\nMoreover, in the payoff matrix, defecting gives us a higher minimum payoff (1) than cooperating (0), and a higher maximum (3 vs 2).\n\nSo the dominant strategy is A1.\n\nBut we are asked to choose a probability distribution \u2014 not a deterministic action.\n\nWhy? Because in mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we might randomize.\n\nLet me compute the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nLet p = probability I play A1\nLet q = probability opponent plays A1\n\nMy expected payoff:\n- If I play A0: 2*(1-q) + 0*q = 2 - 2q\n- If I play A1: 3*(1-q) + 1*q = 3 - 3q + q = 3 - 2q\n\nSet them equal for indifference:\n2 - 2q = 3 - 2q \u2192 2 = 3 \u2192 contradiction.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nMy payoff if I play A0: \n- Opponent A0 (prob 1-q): I get 2\n- Opponent A1 (prob q): I get 0\n\u2192 E[A0] = 2(1-q) + 0*q = 2 - 2q\n\nMy payoff if I play A1:\n- Opponent A0 (prob 1-q): I get 3\n- Opponent A1 (prob q): I get 1\n\u2192 E[A1] = 3(1-q) + 1*q = 3 - 3q + q = 3 - 2q\n\nNow, compare E[A0] and E[A1]:\nE[A1] - E[A0] = (3 - 2q) - (2 - 2q) = 1\n\nSo E[A1] = E[A0] + 1\n\nTherefore, for ANY q, E[A1] > E[A0] by exactly 1.\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0.\n\nTherefore, no matter what the opponent does, I am always better off playing A1.\n\nThus, the only rational choice is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nIn terms of the required output: 100% A1, 0% A0.\n\nEven in repeated games, since A1 is strictly dominant in every round, there is no incentive to cooperate.\n\nThe fact that opponent played D in this round confirms they are likely playing a dominant strategy \u2014 so we should too.\n\nFinal decision: Play A1 with 100% probability.\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a repeated game with the following payoff matrix (for me, the row player):\n\n```\n                Opponent\n                A0    A1\nMe     A0        2,2   0,3\n       A1        3,0   1,1\n```\n\nThis is a classic 2-player, 2-action game. Let me analyze the Nash equilibria.\n\nFirst, check for pure strategy Nash equilibria:\n\n- (A0, A0): I get 2, opponent gets 2.  \n  - If I deviate to A1, I get 3 > 2 \u2192 I want to deviate \u2192 Not equilibrium.\n\n- (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3.  \n  - I want to switch to A1 to get 1 > 0 \u2192 I deviate.  \n  - Opponent gets 3, if they switch to A0, they get 0 < 3 \u2192 they don\u2019t deviate.  \n  \u2192 Not equilibrium (I deviate).\n\n- (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0.  \n  - I get 3, if I switch to A0 \u2192 I get 2 < 3 \u2192 I don\u2019t deviate.  \n  - Opponent gets 0, if they switch to A1 \u2192 they get 1 > 0 \u2192 they deviate.  \n  \u2192 Not equilibrium (opponent deviates).\n\n- (A1, A1): I get 1, opponent gets 1.  \n  - I switch to A0 \u2192 I get 0 < 1 \u2192 don\u2019t deviate.  \n  - Opponent switches to A0 \u2192 gets 0 < 1 \u2192 don\u2019t deviate.  \n  \u2192 This is a Nash equilibrium!\n\nWait \u2014 but (A1, A1) gives both 1, while (A0, A0) gives both 2. So (A0, A0) is Pareto superior, but not a Nash equilibrium because each player has an incentive to deviate to A1 to get 3 instead of 2.\n\nSo the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), but it\u2019s inefficient.\n\nNow, let\u2019s find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nLet me denote:\n- I play A0 with probability p, A1 with probability 1-p.\n- Opponent plays A0 with probability q, A1 with probability 1-q.\n\nI want to find p such that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff from A0:  \n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff from A1:  \n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet them equal for indifference:  \n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be. I think I mixed up who is who.\n\nLet me re-define carefully.\n\nLet me be the row player.  \nOpponent is the column player.\n\nPayoff to ME:\n\n- If I play A0, opponent plays A0 \u2192 I get 2  \n- If I play A0, opponent plays A1 \u2192 I get 0  \n- If I play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 I get 3  \n- If I play A1, opponent plays A1 \u2192 I get 1\n\nPayoff to OPPONENT:\n\n- If I play A0, opponent plays A0 \u2192 opponent gets 2  \n- If I play A0, opponent plays A1 \u2192 opponent gets 3  \n- If I play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 opponent gets 0  \n- If I play A1, opponent plays A1 \u2192 opponent gets 1\n\nSo for the opponent to be indifferent between A0 and A1, given my mixed strategy (p for A0, 1-p for A1):\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff from A0:  \n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff from A1:  \n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet equal:  \n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nThat means there is NO mixed strategy where the opponent is indifferent \u2014 because A1 always gives the opponent 1 more than A0, regardless of p.\n\nWait \u2014 that suggests that A1 is strictly dominant for the opponent!\n\nCheck opponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\nIf I play A0: opponent gets 2 (if A0) vs 3 (if A1) \u2192 prefers A1  \nIf I play A1: opponent gets 0 (if A0) vs 1 (if A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n\nSo no matter what I do, opponent always gets 1 more by playing A1 \u2192 A1 is strictly dominant for opponent.\n\nSimilarly, for me:\n\nIf opponent plays A0: I get 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) \u2192 prefer A1  \nIf opponent plays A1: I get 0 (A0) vs 1 (A1) \u2192 prefer A1\n\nSo A1 is strictly dominant for me too!\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), and both players have a strictly dominant strategy to play A1.\n\nSo in every round, rational players should play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the note says: \u201cThis game is repetitive so your chosen action will be visible to your opponents in future rounds.\u201d\n\nIn Round 4, the opponent (openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)) played D. But our actions are A0 and A1 \u2014 what does \u201cD\u201d mean?\n\nLooking back: the instruction says actions are A0 and A1. But the note says:  \n\u201cRound 4: qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D, openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT): D\u201d\n\nThis is confusing. \u201cD\u201d is not an action in our set.\n\nPossibility: \u201cD\u201d might be a typo or shorthand? In game theory, \u201cD\u201d often stands for \u201cDefect\u201d in Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma.\n\nLet me map:\n\n- A0 = Cooperate?  \n- A1 = Defect?\n\nIn Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma:\n\n- (C,C): both get 3  \n- (C,D): C gets 0, D gets 5  \n- (D,C): C gets 5, D gets 0  \n- (D,D): both get 1\n\nBut our matrix:\n\n- (A0,A0): 2,2  \n- (A0,A1): 0,3  \n- (A1,A0): 3,0  \n- (A1,A1): 1,1\n\nCompare to PD:\n\nIf A0 = C, A1 = D:\n\n- (C,C): 2,2 \u2192 but usually 3,3  \n- (C,D): 0,3 \u2192 matches  \n- (D,C): 3,0 \u2192 matches  \n- (D,D): 1,1 \u2192 matches\n\nSo this is a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma with slightly different payoffs, but same structure:  \nDefect (A1) strictly dominates Cooperate (A0) for both players.\n\nSo \u201cD\u201d in the note likely means A1 (Defect).\n\nSo in Round 4, both players played D = A1.\n\nSince A1 is strictly dominant, and the game is repeated, but there is no incentive to cooperate because:\n\n- Even in repeated play, if the opponent is playing A1 (as they did in Round 4), then my best response is still A1 (since 1 > 0).\n- And since A1 is dominant, they will keep playing A1 regardless of what I do.\n- So there is no way to sustain cooperation \u2014 no trigger strategy can work because the one-shot deviation is always profitable, and the game is finite? We don\u2019t know the total rounds, but since it\u2019s repeated and visible, we might hope for cooperation.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: in a finitely repeated PD with known end, backward induction leads to defection in every round.\n\nEven if infinite, without a credible threat or reputation mechanism, and since the opponent has already shown they play D (A1), and since A1 is dominant, they have no incentive to switch.\n\nTherefore, the rational strategy is to continue playing A1.\n\nMoreover, since I have no way to influence the opponent\u2019s behavior (they are playing a dominant strategy regardless), I should stick to my dominant strategy.\n\nThus, I should play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nFinal decision: {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **me** (the player) is:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2 points\n- (A0, A1): 0 points\n- (A1, A0): 3 points\n- (A1, A1): 1 point\n\nThis is a classic 2x2 game.

Why isn\u2019t that an equilibrium?\n\nBecause in (A1, A0), the opponent gets 0, and they can improve by switching to A1 (getting 1 instead of 0). So opponent has incentive to deviate.\n\nSimilarly, in (A0, A0), I have incentive to switch to A1 to get 3 instead of 2.\n\nSo the **only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**, with payoff (1,1).\n\nBut that\u2019s inefficient \u2014 both players could get 2 if they coordinated on (A0, A0), but that\u2019s not stable because each has incentive to deviate to A1 to get 3.\n\nSo we have two pure Nash equilibria? Wait \u2014 let me double-check.\n\nActually, let me re-analyze (A0, A0):\n\n- My payoff: 2\n- If I deviate to A1: I get 3 \u2192 better \u2192 so I deviate \u2192 not equilibrium.\n\n(A1, A0):\n\n- My payoff: 3\n- Opponent\u2019s payoff: 0\n- Opponent can deviate to A1 \u2192 gets 1 > 0 \u2192 so opponent deviates \u2192 not equilibrium.\n\n(A0, A1):\n\n- My payoff: 0\n- I can deviate to A1 \u2192 get 1 > 0 \u2192 I deviate \u2192 not equilibrium.\n\n(A1, A1):\n\n- My payoff: 1\n- If I deviate to A0 \u2192 get 0 < 1 \u2192 I don\u2019t deviate.\n- Opponent: same logic \u2192 doesn\u2019t deviate.\n\u2192 So **only (A1, A1) is a pure Nash equilibrium**.\n\nBut that\u2019s suboptimal! Both players would prefer (A0, A0) \u2014 but it\u2019s not stable.\n\nThis is a coordination game with two Pareto-ranked equilibria: (A0,A0) gives (2,2), (A1,A1) gives (1,1). But (A0,A0) is not a Nash equilibrium because each player has an incentive to unilaterally switch to A1 to get 3.\n\nWait \u2014 hold on! I think I made a mistake.\n\nLet me re-express the matrix from the perspective of **both players**.\n\nPayoff matrix (my payoff, opponent\u2019s payoff):\n\n- (A0, A0): (2, 2)\n- (A0, A1): (0, 3)\n- (A1, A0): (3, 0)\n- (A1, A1): (1, 1)\n\nNow, let\u2019s check (A0, A0) again:\n\n- If I play A0, and opponent plays A0 \u2192 I get 2.\n- If I unilaterally switch to A1 \u2192 I get 3 (since opponent still plays A0) \u2192 3 > 2 \u2192 I want to switch.\n\u2192 So (A0, A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium.\n\nSimilarly, (A1, A1): I get 1. If I switch to A0, I get 0 (since opponent plays A1) \u2192 0 < 1 \u2192 I don\u2019t switch. Same for opponent. So (A1, A1) **is** a Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut what about (A1, A0)? I get 3, opponent gets 0. Opponent can switch to A1 and get 1 instead of 0 \u2192 so opponent will switch \u2192 not equilibrium.\n\n(A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3. I can switch to A1 and get 1 > 0 \u2192 I switch \u2192 not equilibrium.\n\nSo **only one pure Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1)**.\n\nBut this is a very bad outcome \u2014 both get only 1, while they could get 2 if they both chose A0.\n\nThis is similar to the **Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma**, but not quite \u2014 in PD, (A1,A1) is the only equilibrium and it\u2019s worse than (A0,A0). Here, (A1,A1) is the only pure NE, and (A0,A0) is not stable.\n\nWait \u2014 actually, this game is **identical to the game of Chicken**!\n\nIn Chicken:\n- Both swerve (A0,A0): both get 2 (safe)\n- One swerves, one doesn\u2019t: the one who doesn\u2019t swerve (A1) gets 3, the one who swerves gets 0\n- Both don\u2019t swerve (A1,A1): both crash, get 1\n\nYes! This is exactly Chicken.\n\nIn Chicken, the pure Nash equilibria are the two asymmetric ones: (A1, A0) and (A0, A1). But wait \u2014 earlier I said those aren\u2019t equilibria because the player getting 0 wants to switch.\n\nWait \u2014 let me check (A1, A0) again:\n\n- I play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 I get 3, opponent gets 0.\n- If I switch to A0 \u2192 I get 2 (since opponent still plays A0) \u2192 2 < 3 \u2192 I don\u2019t want to switch.\n- If opponent switches to A1 \u2192 opponent gets 1 (instead of 0) \u2192 1 > 0 \u2192 opponent **wants** to switch.\n\nSo (A1, A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium because the opponent has an incentive to deviate.\n\nSimilarly, (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3. I can switch to A1 and get 1 > 0 \u2192 I want to switch \u2192 not equilibrium.\n\nSo the **only pure Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**.\n\nBut that contradicts standard Chicken game analysis.\n\nWait \u2014 I think I have the payoffs wrong.\n\nIn standard Chicken:\n\n- (Swerve, Swerve): (2,2)\n- (Swerve, Don\u2019t Swerve): (0,3)\n- (Don\u2019t Swerve, Swerve): (3,0)\n- (Don\u2019t Swerve, Don\u2019t Swerve): (-1,-1) \u2014 crash!\n\nBut here, (A1,A1) gives (1,1), not (-1,-1). So it\u2019s **not** Chicken \u2014 it\u2019s a different game.\n\nActually, this is a **coordination game with a risk-dominant equilibrium**.\n\nLet me compute the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.\n\n### Step 2: Find Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium\n\nLet me assume the opponent plays A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1-p).\n\nI want to be indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nMy expected payoff for A0:\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nMy expected payoff for A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet them equal for indifference:\n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be.\n\nThat means my payoff for A1 is **always** 1 point higher than for A0, regardless of p.\n\nLet me check:\n\nE[A0] = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p  \nE[A1] = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo E[A1] = E[A0] + 1\n\nSo **no matter what the opponent does, A1 gives me 1 more point than A0**.\n\nThat means **A1 strictly dominates A0**!\n\nLet me verify:\n\nCompare A1 vs A0:\n\n- If opponent plays A0: A1 gives 3 > 2 \u2192 better\n- If opponent plays A1: A1 gives 1 > 0 \u2192 better\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0**.\n\nTherefore, no matter what the opponent does, I am always better off playing A1.\n\nSo the rational strategy is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nSimilarly, the opponent, being rational, will also realize that A1 dominates A0, so they will play A1.\n\nThus, the unique dominant strategy equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoff (1,1).\n\n### Step 3: Consider the history\n\nThe note says: \u201cRound 5: qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D, openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT): D\u201d\n\nWait \u2014 what is \u201cD\u201d? The actions are A0 and A1.\n\nPossibly \u201cD\u201d stands for \u201cDefect\u201d \u2014 which in this context likely means A1 (since A1 is the dominant strategy, like defecting in PD).\n\nSo both players played D (A1) in the previous round.\n\nThis reinforces that the opponent is likely playing A1, or at least has been playing A1.\n\nGiven that A1 is strictly dominant, and the opponent has played A1 in the last round, it\u2019s even more rational to play A1 again.\n\nThere is no incentive to cooperate (play A0), because even if the opponent plays A0, I get 2 from A0 vs 3 from A1 \u2014 so I still prefer A1.\n\nSo **A1 is strictly dominant**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nI should play A1 with probability 100%, and A0 with 0%.\n\nThis maximizes my expected payoff regardless of opponent\u2019s action.\n\nEven if the opponent tries to coordinate on A0, I have incentive to deviate to A1.\n\nSo the only rational choice is to play A1 with 100% probability.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a repeated game with the following payoff matrix (for me, the row player):\n\n```\n                Opponent\n                A0    A1\nMe      A0       2     0\n        A1       3     1\n```\n\nThis is a 2-player, 2-action game. We are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1, expressed as integers from 0 to 100 that sum to 100.\n\nWe are told this is a repeated game, and our past actions are visible to the opponent. In Round 6, both players chose \"D\" \u2014 but note: the actions are labeled A0 and A1, not D. This might be a notation inconsistency. Since the actions are A0 and A1, I assume \"D\" here is a placeholder or mislabeling, and likely means both chose the same action last round \u2014 but we don't know which one. However, since the payoff matrix is symmetric in structure (but not in values), and we are to maximize our own score, we should focus on game-theoretic equilibrium.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the game.\n\nThis is similar to a \"Battle of the Sexes\" or \"Chicken\" game, but let\u2019s compute the Nash equilibria.\n\nFirst, check for pure strategy Nash equilibria:\n\n1. (A0, A0): I get 2, opponent gets 2.\n   - If I deviate to A1, I get 3 > 2 \u2192 so I want to deviate \u2192 NOT a Nash equilibrium.\n\n2. (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3.\n   - I want to switch to A1 \u2192 get 1 > 0 \u2192 I deviate.\n   - Opponent wants to switch to A0 \u2192 get 2 > 3? No, 2 < 3 \u2192 opponent doesn't want to deviate.\n   - But I do want to deviate \u2192 NOT a Nash equilibrium.\n\n3. (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0.\n   - I have no incentive to deviate (switching to A0 gives 2 < 3).\n   - Opponent wants to switch to A1 \u2192 gets 1 > 0 \u2192 so opponent deviates \u2192 NOT a Nash equilibrium.\n\n4. (A1, A1): I get 1, opponent gets 1.\n   - If I switch to A0 \u2192 get 0 < 1 \u2192 I don\u2019t want to deviate.\n   - Opponent switches to A0 \u2192 gets 2 > 1 \u2192 opponent wants to deviate \u2192 NOT a Nash equilibrium.\n\nSo there are NO pure strategy Nash equilibria.\n\nTherefore, we must look for a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nLet me find the mixed strategy where I randomize such that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nLet p = probability I play A0, so (1-p) = probability I play A1.\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff for playing A0:\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff for playing A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet them equal for indifference:\n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be. That suggests no mixed strategy where opponent is indifferent? That can\u2019t be right.\n\nWait \u2014 I think I confused who is who.\n\nLet me re-define:\n\nLet p = probability that I play A0.\n\nThen opponent\u2019s expected payoff if they play A0:\n= p * (payoff when I play A0 and they play A0) + (1-p) * (payoff when I play A1 and they play A0)\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff if they play A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo opponent\u2019s payoff for A1 is always 1 more than for A0, regardless of p.\n\nThat means: opponent ALWAYS prefers A1, because 2p + 1 > 2p for all p.\n\nSo opponent\u2019s best response is always to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nNow, if opponent always plays A1, what should I do?\n\nIf opponent plays A1:\n- If I play A0 \u2192 I get 0\n- If I play A1 \u2192 I get 1\n\nSo I prefer A1.\n\nSo the only stable outcome is (A1, A1) \u2014 both play A1.\n\nBut earlier we saw (A1, A1) is not a Nash equilibrium because if opponent plays A1, I play A1 (good), but if I play A1, opponent wants to switch to A0 to get 2 instead of 1.\n\nWait \u2014 contradiction?\n\nLet me re-express the payoff matrix clearly.\n\nPayoff matrix (my payoff, opponent\u2019s payoff):\n\n| My Action \\ Opponent Action | A0         | A1         |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------|\n| A0                          | (2, 2)     | (0, 3)     |\n| A1                          | (3, 0)     | (1, 1)     |\n\nNow, if I play A1, opponent\u2019s payoff is:\n- If opponent plays A0: 0\n- If opponent plays A1: 1\n\nSo opponent prefers A1 (1 > 0) \u2192 so if I play A1, opponent plays A1.\n\nIf I play A0, opponent\u2019s payoff:\n- A0: 2\n- A1: 3 \u2192 so opponent prefers A1.\n\nSo no matter what I do, opponent\u2019s best response is always A1.\n\nTherefore, opponent will always play A1.\n\nGiven that, my best response to opponent playing A1 is to play A1 (since 1 > 0).\n\nSo the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1).\n\nEven though it\u2019s not a strict Nash in the sense that opponent could benefit if I changed, but since I know opponent will always play A1 (because it\u2019s dominant), I should play A1.\n\nIs A1 a dominant strategy for opponent?\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\nIf I play A0: opponent gets 2 (if A0) vs 3 (if A1) \u2192 prefers A1\nIf I play A1: opponent gets 0 (if A0) vs 1 (if A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n\nSo YES \u2014 A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for the opponent.\n\nTherefore, regardless of what I do, the opponent will play A1.\n\nSo I should play the best response to A1, which is A1 (gives me 1) rather than A0 (gives me 0).\n\nThus, the rational choice is for me to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the game is repeated, and we are told that in Round 6, both played \"D\". If \"D\" means A1, then this is consistent.\n\nSince the opponent has a dominant strategy to play A1, they will keep playing A1 in future rounds.\n\nTherefore, I should also play A1 to get 1 point instead of 0.\n\nSo my optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nThus, the probability distribution is:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nThis maximizes my expected payoff given the opponent\u2019s dominant strategy.\n\nEven if the opponent is not perfectly rational, since A1 is dominant, we can assume they will play it.\n\nIn repeated games, if one player has a dominant strategy, the other should best respond \u2014 and here, best response is A1.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **me** (the row player) is:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2\n- (A0, A1): 0\n- (A1, A0): 3\n- (A1, A1): 1\n\nThis is a classic 2x2 game. Let me analyze it.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the structure:\n\n| My Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|----------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                     | 2, 2     | 0, 3     |\n| **A1**                     | 3, 0     | 1, 1     |\n\nThis is similar to a **Battle of the Sexes** or **Chicken** game, but let\u2019s check for Nash equilibria.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria\n\n1. (A0, A0): \n   - If I deviate to A1, I get 3 > 2 \u2192 I want to deviate \u2192 Not Nash.\n\n2. (A1, A1):\n   - If I deviate to A0, I get 0 < 1 \u2192 I don\u2019t want to deviate.\n   - Opponent: if they deviate to A0, they get 0 < 1 \u2192 they don\u2019t want to deviate.\n   \u2192 So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\n3. (A0, A1):\n   - I get 0. If I switch to A1, I get 1 > 0 \u2192 I want to deviate \u2192 Not Nash.\n\n4. (A1, A0):\n   - I get 3. Opponent gets 0. If opponent switches to A1, they get 1 > 0 \u2192 they want to deviate \u2192 Not Nash.\n\nSo the **only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**, giving both players 1 point.\n\nBut wait \u2014 (A0, A0) gives 2 each, which is better for both! Why isn\u2019t that a Nash equilibrium?\n\nBecause each player has an incentive to deviate: if I play A0 and you play A0, I can get 3 by switching to A1 (while you stay at A0). So (A0, A0) is **Pareto efficient** but **not Nash**.\n\nSo in a one-shot game, the only stable outcome is (A1, A1), but it\u2019s suboptimal.\n\n### Step 2: Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium\n\nLet\u2019s compute the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nLet me play A0 with probability p, A1 with probability (1-p).\n\nLet opponent play A0 with probability q, A1 with probability (1-q).\n\nI want to choose p such that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff from playing A0:\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff from playing A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet them equal for indifference:\n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 Impossible.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, I think I mixed up who is who.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet **my** probability of playing A0 = p \u2192 A1 = 1-p\n\nLet **opponent\u2019s** probability of playing A0 = q \u2192 A1 = 1-q\n\nNow, for **me** to be indifferent between A0 and A1 (so that opponent can mix), we set my expected payoff from A0 equal to that from A1, **given opponent\u2019s q**.\n\nMy expected payoff if I play A0:\n= q * 2 + (1-q) * 0 = 2q\n\nMy expected payoff if I play A1:\n= q * 3 + (1-q) * 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSet equal:\n2q = 2q + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 Again impossible.\n\nThis suggests **no mixed strategy where I am indifferent** \u2014 because A1 always gives me 1 more than A0, regardless of q.\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s critical.\n\nLet me compute the **difference**:\n\nPayoff(A1) - Payoff(A0) = [3q + 1(1-q)] - [2q + 0(1-q)] = (3q + 1 - q) - 2q = (2q + 1) - 2q = 1\n\nSo **no matter what the opponent does**, playing A1 gives me **1 more point** than playing A0.\n\nThat means **A1 strictly dominates A0** for me.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n- If opponent plays A0: A1 gives 3, A0 gives 2 \u2192 A1 better\n- If opponent plays A1: A1 gives 1, A0 gives 0 \u2192 A1 better\n\nSo **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy** for me.\n\nTherefore, no matter what the opponent does, I should always play A1.\n\nSimilarly, let\u2019s check for the opponent.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\n- If I play A0: opponent gets 2 (if they play A0) or 3 (if they play A1) \u2192 A1 better\n- If I play A1: opponent gets 0 (if they play A0) or 1 (if they play A1) \u2192 A1 better\n\nSo **A1 is also strictly dominant for the opponent**.\n\nTherefore, the **only rational strategy for both players is to play A1 with probability 1**.\n\nThis leads to the outcome (A1, A1), giving both 1 point.\n\nEven though (A0, A0) gives 2 each, it\u2019s not stable \u2014 because each player can unilaterally deviate to A1 and get 3.\n\nSo in a rational, self-interested, simultaneous-move game, **A1 is the only equilibrium strategy**.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Repeated Game and History\n\nThe note says: \u201cThis game is repetitive so your chosen action will be visible to your opponents in future rounds.\u201d\n\nWe are on **Round 7**.\n\nPrevious round (Round 6): both played D.\n\nWait \u2014 what does \u201cD\u201d mean?\n\nThe actions are A0 and A1.\n\nBut the note says: \u201cqwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D, openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT): D\u201d\n\nThis is confusing. The actions are A0 and A1, but the history shows \u201cD\u201d.\n\nPossibility: \u201cD\u201d stands for \u201cDefect\u201d \u2014 which in this context likely corresponds to **A1**, since A1 is the dominant strategy (like defecting in Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma).\n\nIn Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma:\n\n- Cooperate (C) = A0 \u2192 gives 2 if both cooperate\n- Defect (D) = A1 \u2192 gives 3 if opponent cooperates, 1 if both defect\n\nExactly matches our matrix!\n\nSo this is **exactly the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma**:\n\n- (C,C): (2,2)\n- (C,D): (0,3)\n- (D,C): (3,0)\n- (D,D): (1,1)\n\nSo \u201cD\u201d means A1.\n\nSo in Round 6, both played A1.\n\nIn a repeated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, players can use strategies like Tit-for-Tat to sustain cooperation.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: **we are playing simultaneously each round**, and we must output a probability distribution.\n\nAlso, we are not told the opponent\u2019s strategy \u2014 only that in the last round, they played D (A1).\n\nBut since A1 is strictly dominant, **no matter what the opponent did in the past, playing A1 is still optimal**.\n\nEven in repeated games, if the game has a finite horizon and both players are rational, the only Nash equilibrium is to defect in every round (by backward induction).\n\nEven if it\u2019s infinite, unless we have a strategy that punishes defection, cooperation is not sustainable.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **I am not told the opponent\u2019s strategy or intentions**. I only know they played D last round.\n\nBut since A1 is strictly dominant, **I have no incentive to cooperate**, even to encourage future cooperation \u2014 because if I play A0, I get 0 if they play A1 again, and even if they switch to A0, I get 2 \u2014 but I could have gotten 3 if I played A1 and they played A0.\n\nBut they just played A1 \u2014 so if I play A0 now, I get 0.\n\nIf I play A1, I get 1.\n\nSo 1 > 0 \u2192 still better to play A1.\n\nThere is **no benefit** to cooperating now, because:\n\n- I cannot commit to future cooperation in a way that affects this round.\n- The opponent has no incentive to cooperate either (A1 dominates).\n- Even if I try to \u201cpunish\u201d by playing A0, I hurt myself (get 0 instead of 1).\n\nSo **no reason to deviate**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nA1 is strictly dominant for me. Regardless of history, opponent\u2019s behavior, or future rounds, playing A1 maximizes my expected payoff in every round.\n\nTherefore, I should play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **me** (the row player) is:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2\n- (A0, A1): 0\n- (A1, A0): 3\n- (A1, A1): 1\n\nThis is a classic 2x2 game. Let me analyze it.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the structure:\n\n| My Action \\ Opponent | A0       | A1       |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**               | 2, 2     | 0, 3     |\n| **A1**               | 3, 0     | 1, 1     |\n\nThis is similar to a **Battle of the Sexes** or **Chicken** game, but let\u2019s check for Nash equilibria.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria\n\n1. (A0, A0): \n   - If I deviate to A1, I get 3 > 2 \u2192 I want to deviate \u2192 Not Nash.\n\n2. (A1, A1):\n   - If I deviate to A0, I get 0 < 1 \u2192 I don\u2019t want to deviate.\n   - Opponent: if they deviate to A0, they get 0 < 1 \u2192 they don\u2019t want to deviate.\n   \u2192 So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\n3. (A0, A1):\n   - I get 0. If I switch to A1, I get 1 > 0 \u2192 I want to deviate \u2192 Not Nash.\n\n4. (A1, A0):\n   - I get 3. Opponent gets 0. If opponent switches to A1, they get 1 > 0 \u2192 they want to deviate \u2192 Not Nash.\n\nSo the **only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**, giving both players 1 point.\n\nBut wait \u2014 (A0, A0) gives 2 each, which is better for both! Why isn\u2019t that a Nash equilibrium?\n\nBecause each player has an incentive to deviate: if I play A0 and you play A0, I can get 3 by switching to A1. So (A0, A0) is **Pareto efficient** but **not stable**.\n\nSo we have:\n- One efficient but unstable equilibrium: (A0, A0) \u2192 (2,2)\n- One inefficient but stable equilibrium: (A1, A1) \u2192 (1,1)\n\nThis is a coordination game with two equilibria, one better than the other.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist: **this is a repeated game**, and we have history.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the history\n\nRound 8:  \n- Me: D  \n- Opponent: D  \n\nWait \u2014 what does \u201cD\u201d mean? The actions are A0 and A1. But the note says \u201cD\u201d \u2014 likely a typo or shorthand.\n\nGiven the context, and that the only actions are A0 and A1, and the previous rounds are not shown, but this is Round 8, and both played \u201cD\u201d, I suspect \u201cD\u201d stands for **A1**.\n\nWhy? Because in many games, \u201cD\u201d = Defect, and in this payoff matrix, A1 is the \u201cdefect\u201d-like action: it gives you 3 if opponent cooperates (A0), but only 1 if both defect.\n\nIn fact, this matrix is identical to the **Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma** if we relabel:\n\n- A0 = Cooperate (C)\n- A1 = Defect (D)\n\nThen:\n\n- (C,C): 2,2 \u2192 mutual cooperation\n- (C,D): 0,3 \u2192 sucker, temptation\n- (D,C): 3,0 \u2192 temptation, sucker\n- (D,D): 1,1 \u2192 mutual defection\n\nWait \u2014 in standard Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, mutual defection gives less than mutual cooperation, which is true here (1 < 2). But in standard PD, the temptation (3) > reward (2) > punishment (1) > sucker (0). Here: 3 > 2 > 1 > 0 \u2192 **exactly** the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma!\n\nSo this is a **Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma**.\n\nIn a one-shot PD, the only Nash equilibrium is mutual defection (A1, A1).\n\nIn repeated PD, cooperation (A0) can be sustained via strategies like Tit-for-Tat.\n\n### Step 3: What does \u201cD\u201d mean in Round 8?\n\nThe note says:  \n> Round 8: qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D, openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT): D\n\nSince we are in Round 8, and both played \u201cD\u201d, and given the context, \u201cD\u201d almost certainly means **A1** (Defect).\n\nSo both players defected in the previous round.\n\n### Step 4: What should I do now?\n\nWe are in a repeated game. The opponent has just defected (played A1) in Round 8.\n\nWe need to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 for **this round** (Round 9? Or is Round 8 the current round?).\n\nWait \u2014 the instruction says: \u201cRound 8: ...\u201d \u2014 and we are to make a decision **now**, so this is **Round 8**, and the history is that in Round 8, both played D (A1). But that doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 we are choosing our action **for** Round 8.\n\nAh \u2014 I think the note is telling us what happened in **previous rounds**, and we are now playing **Round 8**.\n\nBut the note says: \u201cRound 8: qwen: D, openai: D\u201d \u2014 this is likely the **outcome of Round 8**, meaning we are being told what happened in Round 8, and now we are to play Round 9?\n\nBut the instruction says: \u201cRound 8: ...\u201d and then asks us to choose for this round.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nBut the instruction says: \u201cRound 8: qwen: D, openai: D\u201d \u2014 and then says \u201cThink about the question step by step...\u201d \u2014 so I believe this is **Round 8**, and the \u201cD\u201d is the **action we and the opponent chose in this round** \u2014 but that can\u2019t be, because we are choosing now.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the \u201cD\u201d is a **mistake**, and it\u2019s meant to be the **history of previous rounds**? But it says \u201cRound 8: ...\u201d, so likely this is the **current round**, and we are to choose our action **now**, and the \u201cD\u201d is a red herring or placeholder.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \u201cD\u201d is the **name** of the opponent\u2019s strategy, not the action.\n\nBut the instruction says: \u201cyour chosen action will be visible to your opponents in future rounds\u201d \u2014 so the history matters.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the most reasonable interpretation is:\n\n> The note \u201cRound 8: qwen: D, openai: D\u201d is **the outcome of the previous round (Round 7)**, and we are now playing **Round 8**.\n\nWhy? Because we are being asked to choose our action **for this round**, and the history is given.\n\nSo: In Round 7, both players played D = A1.\n\nWe are now in Round 8.\n\nWe know the opponent defected last round.\n\nWe are playing a repeated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma.\n\n### Step 5: Strategy in Repeated PD\n\nIn repeated PD, the optimal strategy depends on the opponent\u2019s behavior.\n\nSince the opponent defected last round, a good response is to defect again \u2014 Tit-for-Tat.\n\nBut Tit-for-Tat is deterministic: play what opponent played last time.\n\nBut we are allowed to play **mixed strategies** \u2014 probabilities.\n\nWe want to maximize our **expected score** over time.\n\nIf we always defect, we get 1 per round.\n\nIf we can get mutual cooperation (A0,A0), we get 2 per round \u2014 better.\n\nBut if we play A0 (cooperate) and opponent plays A1 (defect), we get 0 \u2014 very bad.\n\nSo we need to incentivize cooperation.\n\nBut the opponent has just defected. So if we play A0 now, we get exploited.\n\nSo the rational response is to play A1 again \u2014 to punish.\n\nBut if we always play A1, we get stuck at 1 forever.\n\nWe need to consider: is the opponent likely to cooperate if we do?\n\nWe don\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\nBut the opponent is named \u201copenai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)\u201d \u2014 likely an AI that can reason.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s playing a strategy like Tit-for-Tat.\n\nIf the opponent played D in Round 7, maybe they are responding to our previous move.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what we played in Round 7 \u2014 but the note says we played D.\n\nSo both played D in Round 7.\n\nSo the opponent is not retaliating \u2014 they are just playing D regardless.\n\nSo perhaps the opponent is a **constant defector**.\n\nIn that case, the best response is to always play A1 \u2014 because if opponent always plays A1, then:\n\n- If I play A0: I get 0\n- If I play A1: I get 1\n\nSo I should always play A1 \u2192 get 1 per round.\n\nIf I ever play A0, I get 0 \u2014 worse.\n\nSo if opponent is a constant defector, I should be one too.\n\nIs there any reason to believe the opponent will cooperate?\n\nWe have no evidence of cooperation. Both played D last round.\n\nSo the safest assumption is: opponent is a defector.\n\nTherefore, best response: play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if we try to \u201cbreak the cycle\u201d?\n\nSuppose we play A0 with some probability p.\n\nThen expected payoff:\n\nE = p * [prob_opponent_A0 * 2 + prob_opponent_A1 * 0] + (1-p) * [prob_opponent_A0 * 3 + prob_opponent_A1 * 1]\n\nBut we don\u2019t know opponent\u2019s probability.\n\nWe only know their last action: A1.\n\nIn repeated games, we often assume the opponent plays a fixed strategy.\n\nGiven that they played A1 last time, and we have no reason to believe they will change, we should assume they will play A1 again.\n\nSo assume opponent plays A1 with probability 1.\n\nThen:\n\n- If I play A0: I get 0\n- If I play A1: I get 1\n\nSo I should play A1 with probability 1.\n\nThus, optimal: {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nBut is there a mixed strategy equilibrium?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose opponent plays A1 with probability 1.\n\nThen my best response is A1 with probability 1.\n\nIf opponent plays A0 with probability 1, my best response is A1 (3 > 2).\n\nSo no matter what, A1 is strictly dominant.\n\nWait \u2014 is A1 strictly dominant?\n\nCompare:\n\n- If opponent plays A0: I get 3 (A1) vs 2 (A0) \u2192 prefer A1\n- If opponent plays A1: I get 1 (A1) vs 0 (A0) \u2192 prefer A1\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0**.\n\nTherefore, regardless of what the opponent does, I am always better off playing A1.\n\nSo the dominant strategy is A1.\n\nTherefore, even in repeated play, since A1 dominates A0, I should always play A1.\n\nThe fact that (A0,A0) gives higher payoff is irrelevant \u2014 because I can\u2019t rely on the opponent to play A0.\n\nAnd since A1 is dominant, I should play it with 100% probability.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nI should play A1 with probability 100%.\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **me** (the row player) is:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2\n- (A0, A1): 0\n- (A1, A0): 3\n- (A1, A1): 1\n\nThis is a classic 2x2 game. Let me analyze it.\n\nFirst, note that this is **not** a symmetric zero-sum game \u2014 payoffs are not opposites. But we can still analyze it using game theory.\n\nLet me denote:\n- My probability of playing A0 as `p`, so A1 is `1-p`\n- Opponent\u2019s probability of playing A0 as `q`, so A1 is `1-q`\n\nMy expected payoff is:\nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n\nSimplify:\nE = 2pq + 0 + 3q(1-p) + (1-p)(1-q)\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + (1 - q - p + pq)\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q - p - q + 1\n= (0) + 2q - p + 1\n= -p + 2q + 1\n\nWait \u2014 let me recompute that carefully:\n\nE = 2pq + 0 + 3q(1-p) + 1*(1-p)(1-q)\n\nExpand each term:\n- 2pq\n- 3q(1-p) = 3q - 3pq\n- (1-p)(1-q) = 1 - q - p + pq\n\nNow sum all:\nE = 2pq + (3q - 3pq) + (1 - q - p + pq)\n= 2pq - 3pq + pq + 3q - q - p + 1\n= (0)pq + 2q - p + 1\n= -p + 2q + 1\n\nSo my expected payoff is: **E = -p + 2q + 1**\n\nThis is linear in p and q.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **I don\u2019t know q** (opponent\u2019s strategy). However, we are told this is a **repetitive game**, and in **Round 9**, the opponent (openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)) played **D**.\n\nWait \u2014 the actions are labeled A0 and A1, but the note says:  \n> Round 9: qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D, openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT): D\n\nThis is confusing. The actions are A0 and A1, but the note says \"D\". This might be a typo or shorthand.\n\nPossibility 1: \"D\" stands for \"Defect\" \u2014 which in many games corresponds to A1 (the more aggressive action).  \nPossibility 2: \"D\" stands for \"Cooperate\" \u2014 which might be A0.\n\nBut in the payoff matrix:\n- If I play A0 and opponent plays A1 \u2192 I get 0, they get 3 \u2192 that looks like being \"suckered\"\n- If I play A1 and opponent plays A0 \u2192 I get 3, they get 0 \u2192 that looks like \"defecting and exploiting\"\n- Both A0: 2,2 \u2192 mutual cooperation\n- Both A1: 1,1 \u2192 mutual defection\n\nThis is **exactly** the structure of the **Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma**!\n\nStandard Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma payoffs:\n- (C,C): 3,3\n- (C,D): 0,5\n- (D,C): 5,0\n- (D,D): 1,1\n\nBut here:\n- (A0,A0): 2,2 \u2192 mutual cooperation\n- (A0,A1): 0,3 \u2192 I cooperate, opponent defects \u2192 I get 0 (sucker), they get 3 (temptation)\n- (A1,A0): 3,0 \u2192 I defect, opponent cooperates \u2192 I get 3 (temptation), they get 0 (sucker)\n- (A1,A1): 1,1 \u2192 mutual defection\n\nSo A0 = Cooperate (C), A1 = Defect (D)\n\nTherefore, when the note says:\n> Round 9: qwen: D, openai: D\n\nThat means **both played A1 (Defect)** in Round 9.\n\nSo the opponent played A1 (Defect) last round.\n\nNow, since this is a repeated game, and the opponent has just played D (A1), we might suspect they are playing a **grim trigger**, **tit-for-tat**, or **always defect** strategy.\n\nBut we are trying to **maximize our own score**.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the best response.\n\nFrom my expected payoff: E = -p + 2q + 1\n\nTo maximize E, since it\u2019s linear in p and q:\n\n- If I believe q is fixed (opponent\u2019s strategy is known or predictable), I should choose p to maximize E.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know q exactly. However, I have a signal: in the last round, opponent played A1 (D).\n\nAssume the opponent is playing a **best response** to me, or is playing **always D**.\n\nCase 1: Opponent is playing **always A1** (q = 0, since q = P(opponent plays A0))\n\nThen E = -p + 2*0 + 1 = -p + 1\n\nTo maximize E, I want to minimize p \u2192 set p = 0 \u2192 play A1 with probability 1.\n\nThen my payoff = 1 (since both play A1)\n\nCase 2: Opponent is playing **always A0** (q = 1)\n\nThen E = -p + 2*1 + 1 = -p + 3 \u2192 maximize by setting p=1 \u2192 play A0 \u2192 get 2\n\nBut opponent just played A1, so it\u2019s unlikely they are playing A0.\n\nCase 3: Opponent is playing **tit-for-tat** \u2014 they copy my last move.\n\nIn Round 9, I played D (A1), so opponent played D (A1) in response.\n\nSo if they are tit-for-tat, they will play A1 again in Round 10 if I played A1 in Round 9.\n\nSo if I play A1 again, they play A1 \u2192 I get 1\n\nIf I play A0, they play A0 \u2192 I get 2\n\nSo if they are tit-for-tat, I can get 2 by switching to A0.\n\nBut is tit-for-tat likely? We don\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\nBut note: in Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, the **Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1) \u2014 both defect \u2014 because A1 is the dominant strategy.\n\nLet\u2019s check dominance:\n\nFor me:\n- If opponent plays A0: I get 2 (if A0) vs 3 (if A1) \u2192 prefer A1\n- If opponent plays A1: I get 0 (if A0) vs 1 (if A1) \u2192 prefer A1\n\nSo **A1 is strictly dominant** for me.\n\nSimilarly for opponent: A1 is strictly dominant.\n\nSo the only Nash equilibrium is both play A1.\n\nIn repeated games, if the game is finitely repeated, the only subgame perfect equilibrium is always defect.\n\nBut if it\u2019s infinitely repeated, cooperation can be sustained.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how many rounds total, but since we\u2019re on Round 9, and it\u2019s repetitive, it might be long.\n\nHowever, **the opponent just played D**. That suggests they are not cooperating.\n\nIf I switch to A0 now, and they are playing always D, I get 0.\n\nIf I play A1, I get 1.\n\nSo 1 > 0 \u2192 better to play A1.\n\nIf they are tit-for-tat, and I play A0, they might switch to A0 next round, and then I can get 2 next round \u2014 but I get 0 this round.\n\nSo my payoff this round: 0 vs 1 \u2192 I lose 1 point.\n\nIs it worth it? Only if I expect future gains.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how many rounds remain. If this is the last round, then no future gains \u2014 so I should defect.\n\nIf there are many rounds, maybe I can trigger cooperation.\n\nBut the opponent has just defected \u2014 and I defected too. So we are in mutual defection.\n\nTo break out, I need to cooperate \u2014 but if they are not reciprocating, I get 0.\n\nGiven that the opponent is named openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT) \u2014 likely a sophisticated agent \u2014 it might be playing tit-for-tat or grim trigger.\n\nBut in Round 9, we both played D. So if they are tit-for-tat, they are responding to my D.\n\nSo if I play A0 now (cooperate), they might play A0 next round.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know if they will.\n\nHowever, since the game is repeated and we want to maximize **long-term** score, and mutual cooperation gives 2 per round vs mutual defection 1, it\u2019s better to cooperate if reciprocated.\n\nBut to get cooperation, I need to start cooperating.\n\nBut if I cooperate now and they defect, I get 0 \u2014 worse than 1.\n\nSo the risk is high.\n\nIn standard game theory, if the opponent has just defected, and we don\u2019t know their strategy, the safest is to continue defecting \u2014 because defecting is dominant.\n\nMoreover, since the opponent has shown no sign of cooperation (they played D), and we have no reason to believe they will switch, the rational choice is to play the dominant strategy: A1.\n\nAlso, note: if I play A0, and they play A1 again, I get 0 \u2014 which is worse than 1.\n\nSo unless I am confident they will reciprocate, I should not cooperate.\n\nGiven the information, I have no reason to believe they will switch.\n\nTherefore, I will play A1 with probability 1.\n\nSo my probability distribution: A0: 0%, A1: 100%\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}]]

Let:\n- p = probability we choose A0\n- (1-p) = probability we choose A1\n\nSimilarly, let q be the probability the opponent chooses A0, and (1-q) for A1.\n\nOur expected payoff (U) is:\nU = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait, let me recalculate carefully:\n\nU = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p) * [3q + 1*(1-q)]\n  = p * (2q) + (1-p) * (3q + 1 - q)\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = (2pq - 2pq) + 2q + 1 - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo our expected payoff is: U = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nThis means:\n- If we increase p (choose A0 more), our payoff decreases linearly.\n- If the opponent increases q (chooses A0 more), our payoff increases linearly.\n\nTherefore, to maximize our payoff regardless of what the opponent does, we should minimize p (since it has a negative coefficient) and hope the opponent maximizes q (which benefits us). However, we cannot control the opponent.\n\nBut note: the opponent is symmetric and rational, and will similarly try to maximize their own payoff. Their expected payoff (V) is:\nV = q * [p*2 + (1-p)*0] + (1-q) * [p*3 + (1-p)*1]\n  = q * (2p) + (1-q)(3p + 1 - p)\n  = 2pq + (1-q)(2p + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2p + 1 - 2pq - q\n  = 2p + 1 - q\n\nSo the opponent's payoff is V = 2p + 1 - q. They want to minimize q (since it has negative coefficient) and hope we maximize p.\n\nNow, if both players are rational, we can look for a Nash equilibrium where neither can improve by changing their strategy unilaterally.\n\nSet derivatives to zero? Actually, since the payoffs are linear, we look for mixed strategy equilibrium.\n\nSuppose we choose p. The opponent will choose q to maximize V = 2p + 1 - q. Since this is decreasing in q, the opponent will set q as low as possible: q=0. So if we set any p, the opponent's best response is q=0.\n\nBut if q=0, then our payoff U = 2*0 + 1 - p = 1 - p. To maximize this, we set p=0.\n\nSo if we set p=0 (always A1), opponent sets q=0 (always A1), then we get (1,1). Is this stable?\n- If we change to p>0, our payoff becomes 1 - p < 1.\n- If opponent changes to q>0, their payoff becomes 2p + 1 - q. With p=0, this is 1 - q < 1.\n\nSo (p=0, q=0) is a Nash equilibrium: both always choose A1.\n\nBut is there another equilibrium? Suppose the opponent sets q=1. Then our payoff U = 2*1 + 1 - p = 3 - p. To maximize, we set p=0. But if we set p=0, opponent's payoff V = 2*0 + 1 - 1 = 0, which is worse than if they set q=0 (which gives 1). So they wouldn't set q=1.\n\nWhat if we set p=1? Then opponent's payoff V = 2*1 + 1 - q = 3 - q. To maximize, they set q=0. Then our payoff U = 2*0 + 1 - 1 = 0, which is worse than if we set p=0.\n\nSo the only symmetric Nash equilibrium is both playing A1 with probability 1.\n\nHowever, note that if both play A0, they get (2,2) which is better than (1,1). But that is not stable because each has an incentive to deviate to A1 to get 3 (if opponent plays A0) or to avoid getting 0 (if opponent plays A1). So the safe strategy is to play A1.\n\nIn fact, A1 is the dominant strategy? Compare:\n- If opponent plays A0: we get 3 with A1 vs 2 with A0 -> better to play A1.\n- If opponent plays A1: we get 1 with A1 vs 0 with A0 -> better to play A1.\n\nSo regardless of what the opponent does, we get a higher payoff by choosing A1.

We can look for a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Let\u2019s denote our strategy\nLet:\n- p = probability we choose A0\n- (1-p) = probability we choose A1\n\nLet the opponent choose:\n- q = probability opponent chooses A0\n- (1-q) = probability opponent chooses A1\n\nOur expected payoff is:\n\nE = p * [q * 2 + (1-q) * 0] + (1-p) * [q * 3 + (1-q) * 1]\n\nSimplify:\n\nE = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]  \nE = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)  \nE = 2pq + (2q + 1 - 2pq - p)  \nE = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p  \nE = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait \u2014 that simplifies nicely!\n\nSo:  \n**Our expected payoff = 2q + 1 - p**\n\nBut this is our payoff as a function of our own p and opponent\u2019s q.\n\nBut we are choosing p to maximize our payoff, and the opponent is choosing q to maximize theirs.\n\nWe need to find a Nash equilibrium: a pair (p*, q*) such that each is a best response to the other.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find opponent\u2019s best response to our p\n\nLet\u2019s compute the opponent\u2019s expected payoff when they choose A0 or A1, given our p.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff if they choose A0:\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff if they choose A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo:\n- If opponent chooses A0: gets 2p\n- If opponent chooses A1: gets 2p + 1\n\nNotice: 2p + 1 > 2p for all p.\n\nSo **no matter what p we choose, the opponent always gets 1 more point by choosing A1 than A0**.\n\nTherefore, the opponent\u2019s **strictly dominant strategy** is to choose A1 with probability 1.\n\nSo q = 0 (they never choose A0), q = 1 for A1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Given opponent plays A1 with probability 1, what should we do?\n\nIf opponent always plays A1, then:\n\n- If we play A0: we get 0\n- If we play A1: we get 1\n\nSo we should play A1 with probability 1 to get 1 point instead of 0.\n\nThus, our best response is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Is (A1, A1) a Nash equilibrium?\n\n- If we play A1, opponent\u2019s best response: as above, A1 gives 1, A0 gives 0 \u2192 so A1 is best.\n- If opponent plays A1, our best response: A1 gives 1, A0 gives 0 \u2192 so A1 is best.\n\nSo (A1, A1) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a mixed strategy equilibrium?\n\nSuppose we try to make the opponent indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nFor opponent to be indifferent:\n\nPayoff from A0 = Payoff from A1  \n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo **no mixed strategy equilibrium exists** where opponent is indifferent \u2014 because A1 strictly dominates A0 for the opponent.\n\nSimilarly, for us: if opponent plays A1, we strictly prefer A1 (1 > 0).\n\nSo the **only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: What should we play?\n\nSince the opponent is rational and will also realize that A1 strictly dominates A0, they will play A1 with probability 1.\n\nTherefore, we should also play A1 with probability 1 to get 1 point instead of 0.\n\nEven if we thought they might randomize, we saw that A1 is strictly dominant for them \u2014 so they *must* play A1.\n\nThus, our optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from your perspective):\n\n| You \\ Opponent | A0     | A1     |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| A0             | 2      | 0      |\n| A1             | 3      | 1      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1. Let:\n- p = probability of choosing A0\n- (1-p) = probability of choosing A1\n\nSimilarly, let q be the probability that the opponent chooses A0, and (1-q) for A1.\n\nYour expected payoff is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [2q + 1]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q+1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo, E = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nThis means your payoff depends on both your choice and the opponent's. To maximize your expected payoff, you want to minimize p (since it has a negative coefficient) and hope that q is high. However, you don't control q.\n\nThis is a classic \"game of chicken\" or \"hawk-dove\" type game. The Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies can be found by making the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n\nTo find the mixed strategy that makes the opponent indifferent:\n\nOpponent's expected payoff if they choose A0:\nE_opp(A0) = q * 2 + (1-q)*0 = 2q\n\nOpponent's expected payoff if they choose A1:\nE_opp(A1) = q * 3 + (1-q)*1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSet them equal to make opponent indifferent:\n2q = 2q + 1\nThis has no solution. Wait, that suggests that the opponent always prefers A1? Because E_opp(A1) = 2q+1 > 2q = E_opp(A0) for all q. So the opponent should always choose A1.\n\nBut let's double-check the payoffs from opponent's perspective (since the game is symmetric):\n\nIf opponent chooses A0:\n- vs your A0: they get 2\n- vs your A1: they get 0\n\nIf opponent chooses A1:\n- vs your A0: they get 3\n- vs your A1: they get 1\n\nSo indeed, regardless of what you do, the opponent gets a higher payoff by choosing A1 (3 or 1) than by choosing A0 (2 or 0). Therefore, the opponent should always choose A1 (i.e., q=0).\n\nGiven that, your expected payoff becomes:\nE = 2*0 + 1 - p = 1 - p.\n\nTo maximize this, you should set p as low as possible, i.e., always choose A1 (p=0). But if both always choose A1, you get 1 point each.\n\nHowever, if you both always choose A1, that is a Nash equilibrium: no one has incentive to deviate. If you deviate to A0 while opponent is always A1, you get 0 which is worse than 1. Similarly for opponent.\n\nBut is there a better response? If you know opponent will always choose A1, your best response is to choose A1 (get 1) rather than A0 (get 0). So indeed, both choosing A1 is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut wait, there is also a mixed strategy? Actually, since the opponent strictly prefers A1, they will always play A1. So you should always play A1 as well.\n\nHowever, in the first round, the opponent (qwen) played \"D\", which might be a typo? The actions are A0 and A1. Perhaps \"D\" means something else? But according to the rules, actions are only A0 and A1.\n\nLooking back: \"Round 1: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\"\n\nThis might be a mistake. Perhaps \"D\" stands for \"defect\" or something, but in this context, we have only A0 and A1. Let me assume that \"D\" corresponds to A1 (which is the aggressive action) and \"C\" would be A0 (cooperative). This is common in prisoner's dilemma-like games.\n\nSo in round 1, both played D (A1). So both got 1 point.\n\nNow, since the game is repetitive, and opponents can see previous actions, we need to consider strategy.\n\nBut given the payoffs, the dominant strategy for both is to always choose A1. Because no matter what the opponent does, A1 gives a higher or equal payoff:\n\nIf opponent plays A0: you get 3 with A1 vs 2 with A0 -> better to play A1.\nIf opponent plays A1: you get 1 with A1 vs 0 with A0 -> better to play A1.\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0. Therefore, the rational strategy is to always play A1.\n\nTherefore, we should set probability of A1 to 100%.\n\nSo for this round, we choose {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}.\n\nEven though it's repetitive, since the opponent is rational (qwen is also an AI), it will also always play A1. So we have no reason to deviate.\n\nThus, the answer is clear.\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for ME (the row player) is:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2\n- (A0, A1): 0\n- (A1, A0): 3\n- (A1, A1): 1\n\nThis is a classic 2x2 game.

Wait, let\u2019s check:\n\nActually:\n- When opponent plays A0: A1 (3) > A0 (2)\n- When opponent plays A1: A1 (1) > A0 (0)\n\nSo A1 gives me 3 or 1, A0 gives me 2 or 0. In both cases, A1 gives me a higher payoff.\n\nWait \u2014 that would mean A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for me?\n\nLet me verify:\n\n- If opponent chooses A0: I get 3 with A1 vs 2 with A0 \u2192 A1 better\n- If opponent chooses A1: I get 1 with A1 vs 0 with A0 \u2192 A1 better\n\nYes!

Yes, because both have strictly dominant strategies.\n\nSo rational players should both play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nBut let\u2019s check the history: In Round 1, the opponent (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)) played \"D\".

In many games, \"D\" stands for \"Defect\" \u2014 which in this context, since A1 gives higher payoff regardless, and is dominant, it's likely that \"D\" = A1.\n\nSimilarly, \"C\" might mean \"Cooperate\" = A0.\n\nSo if both played \"D\", that means both played A1.\n\nThat\u2019s consistent with the Nash equilibrium.\n\nSo in Round 1, opponent played A1.\n\nNow, since A1 is strictly dominant, no matter what the opponent did in the past, the best response is still to play A1.\n\nEven if opponent cooperates (plays A0), I get 3 by playing A1 \u2014 better than 2 from A0.\n\nIf opponent defects (A1), I get 1 from A1 \u2014 better than 0 from A0.\n\nSo A1 is always better.\n\nTherefore, my optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nI should output:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nThis maximizes my expected payoff regardless of opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\nEven if opponent changes strategy in future rounds, A1 remains dominant.\n\nSo I stick with A1.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nThis is similar to a \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game. The Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies can be found by making the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n\nLet:\n- p = probability that you choose A0\n- q = probability that opponent chooses A0 (but we are choosing for ourselves, so we'll set up for our own mix)\n\nActually, to find our optimal mixed strategy, we should make the opponent indifferent between their actions. However, since we are choosing our own probability, we need to compute the best response.\n\nBut note: the instruction says to maximize our score. Since the game is repetitive and we are in round 2, we have history: in round 1, both players chose \"D\" (which I assume corresponds to A1? But wait, the actions are A0 and A1, and \"D\" might be a typo? Actually, the note says \"Round 2: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\". Probably \"D\" stands for \"Defect\" which is A1? Because in such games, A1 is often the defection action. Similarly, \"C\" for cooperate would be A0.\n\nSo in round 1, both defected (A1). So both got 1 point.\n\nNow for round 2, we need to choose a probability distribution.\n\nTo compute the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:\n\nLet p be the probability that we choose A0, and 1-p for A1.\nSimilarly, let q be the probability that opponent chooses A0, and 1-q for A1.\n\nOur expected payoff is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p   [Wait, let me recalculate carefully:]\n\nActually:\nE = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p)*[3q + 1*(1-q)]\n  = p * (2q) + (1-p)*(3q + 1 - q)\n  = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = (2q + 1) - p\n\nSo our expected payoff is: E = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nThis is interesting: it depends on both p and q. To maximize given q, we should set p as low as possible (since coefficient is negative) if we assume q is fixed. But we don't know q.\n\nHowever, in mixed Nash equilibrium, we choose p to make the opponent indifferent.\n\nOpponent's expected payoff if they choose A0:\nE_opp(A0) = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n\nOpponent's expected payoff if they choose A1:\nE_opp(A1) = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nTo make opponent indifferent, set 2p = 2p + 1? This is impossible. So there is no mixed strategy that makes opponent indifferent? Actually, note that E_opp(A1) is always 1 more than E_opp(A0). So opponent always prefers A1 regardless of our p. Therefore, the opponent should always choose A1 (q=0).\n\nSimilarly, from our payoff: E = 2q + 1 - p. If opponent always chooses A1 (q=0), then E = 1 - p. To maximize, we should set p=0 (always A1).\n\nBut if both always choose A1, we get (1,1). However, if we choose A0 when opponent chooses A1, we get 0 which is worse. So indeed, A1 is dominant? Actually, check:\n\nIf opponent chooses A0: we get 3 for A1 vs 2 for A0 -> better to choose A1.\nIf opponent chooses A1: we get 1 for A1 vs 0 for A0 -> better to choose A1.\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0. Therefore, the rational choice is to always choose A1.\n\nBut in round 1, both chose A1. So for round 2, the Nash equilibrium is to choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nHowever, the game is repetitive. Perhaps we can try to cooperate? But since the opponent is also rational, they might think the same. But note: the opponent is another AI (qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)), which might also reason similarly.\n\nGiven that both defected in round 1, if we cooperate (A0) in round 2, we might get 0 if opponent defects. So it's risky.\n\nBut to maximize long-term score? The instruction says \"maximise your score\", and it's repetitive. But we are only in round 2, and we don't know how many rounds. However, the instruction doesn't specify the number of rounds. So we should assume it's a one-shot? Actually, the note says \"this game is repetitive\", meaning we play multiple rounds, and choices are visible.\n\nBut for this round, we need to choose a probability.\n\nGiven that A1 is strictly dominant, the best response is always to defect. However, if both always defect, we get 1 each round. If both cooperate, we get 2. So there is incentive to cooperate.\n\nBut without communication, it's hard. Since we are in round 2, and both defected in round 1, we might try to signal cooperation by cooperating with some probability.\n\nA common strategy in repetitive games is \"tit-for-tat\": start by cooperating, then do what the opponent did last time. But here, last time both defected. So tit-for-tat would defect.\n\nBut we want to maximize score. Perhaps we can try to cooperate with a small probability to see if opponent responds.\n\nHowever, the opponent is another AI that might reason similarly.\n\nGiven the strict dominance, the safe choice is to defect. But let's calculate the mixed Nash equilibrium again: actually, there is no mixed Nash because A1 is strictly dominant. So pure Nash is (A1, A1).\n\nTherefore, the rational choice is to choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nBut to encourage cooperation, we might choose a mixed strategy that sometimes cooperates. However, since the opponent might defect always, we should defect.\n\nGiven that it's only round 2, and we have many rounds ahead, we might try to cooperate with a small probability.\n\nBut to be precise, let's think about the expected payoff.\n\nSuppose we choose p for A0, 1-p for A1.\nOpponent: we don't know. But from round 1, they defected. So they might defect again.\n\nIf opponent defects with probability 1, our expected payoff is:\nE = p*0 + (1-p)*1 = 1 - p.\nTo maximize, set p=0.\n\nIf opponent cooperates with probability q, then:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p)*[q*3 + (1-q)*1] = 2pq + (1-p)(3q + 1 - q) = 2pq + (1-p)(2q+1) = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nSo if we believe opponent will cooperate with some probability, we can adjust.\n\nBut without knowledge, the safe is to defect.\n\nHowever, since the game is repetitive, we can try to set a precedent.\n\nBut for this round, I will choose to defect with high probability, but leave a small chance to cooperate.\n\nActually, to exactly follow the Nash equilibrium, we should defect always.\n\nBut let's see what the opponent might do: they are also rational. They might think the same.\n\nSo for round 2, I will choose to defect with 100% probability.\n\nTherefore, the probability distribution is: A0:0, A1:100.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a repeated game with the following payoff matrix (for me, the row player):\n\n```\n                Opponent\n                A0     A1\nMe      A0      2,2    0,3\n        A1      3,0    1,1\n```\n\nThis is a 2x2 simultaneous-move game. I need to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (as percentages summing to 100).\n\nFirst, let\u2019s analyze the game structure.\n\nThis is similar to the classic \"Battle of the Sexes\" or a variant of \"Chicken\", but let\u2019s check for Nash equilibria.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria\n\nCheck each pure strategy profile:\n\n1. (A0, A0): I get 2, opponent gets 2.\n   - If I deviate to A1: I get 3 > 2 \u2192 I want to deviate \u2192 Not Nash.\n\n2. (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3.\n   - I want to switch to A1: I get 1 > 0 \u2192 I want to deviate.\n   - Opponent wants to switch to A0: they get 2 < 3 \u2192 they don\u2019t want to deviate.\n   \u2192 Not Nash (I want to deviate).\n\n3. (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0.\n   - I don\u2019t want to deviate (switching to A0 gives me 2 < 3).\n   - Opponent wants to switch to A1: they get 1 > 0 \u2192 they want to deviate.\n   \u2192 Not Nash.\n\n4. (A1, A1): I get 1, opponent gets 1.\n   - I deviate to A0: I get 0 < 1 \u2192 don\u2019t want to.\n   - Opponent deviates to A0: they get 0 < 1 \u2192 don\u2019t want to.\n   \u2192 This is a Nash equilibrium!\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s surprising. Let me double-check:\n\nAt (A1, A1): both get 1.\n\nIf I switch to A0 while opponent stays at A1: I get 0 \u2192 worse.\nIf opponent switches to A0 while I stay at A1: they get 0 \u2192 worse.\n\nSo yes, (A1, A1) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut what about (A0, A0)? I get 2, opponent gets 2.\n\nIf I switch to A1: I get 3 > 2 \u2192 so I have incentive to deviate \u2192 not Nash.\n\nSo only (A1, A1) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there another?\n\nWhat if opponent plays A0? Then I prefer A1 (3 > 2).\nWhat if opponent plays A1? Then I prefer A1 (1 > 0).\n\nSo my best response to A0 is A1.\nMy best response to A1 is A1.\n\nSo A1 is a dominant strategy for me?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\n- If opponent plays A0: I get 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) \u2192 prefer A1\n- If opponent plays A1: I get 0 (A0) vs 1 (A1) \u2192 prefer A1\n\nSo YES \u2014 A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for me!\n\nSimilarly, for the opponent:\n\n- If I play A0: opponent gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n- If I play A1: opponent gets 0 (A0) vs 1 (A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n\nSo A1 is also a strictly dominant strategy for the opponent!\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), and both players have a dominant strategy to play A1.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the history\n\nThe note says: \u201cRound 2: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\u201d\n\nWait \u2014 what does \u201cD\u201d mean? The actions are A0 and A1.\n\nPossibly \u201cD\u201d stands for \u201cdefect\u201d or \u201cA1\u201d? In many games, A1 might be interpreted as the \u201cdefect\u201d action (since it gives higher payoff if opponent cooperates, but lower mutual payoff).\n\nIn this case, since A1 is the dominant strategy, and the opponent in Round 2 played \u201cD\u201d \u2014 likely meaning A1 \u2014 then we can assume that the opponent is playing A1.\n\nBut we are in Round 2, and we are the second player in that round? The note says:\n\n> Round 2: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\n\nSo both players played D in Round 2. Since we are qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT), we played D (A1) in Round 2.\n\nNow we are playing Round 3? The instruction says \u201cRound 2\u201d but then gives history of Round 2. Probably this is Round 3, and we are to respond based on the previous round.\n\nBut the instruction says: \u201cRound 2: ...\u201d \u2014 perhaps it\u2019s a typo and this is Round 3.\n\nRegardless, the key is: the opponent played A1 (D) in the previous round.\n\nGiven that A1 is a dominant strategy, the rational thing to do is to continue playing A1.\n\nEven if we try to cooperate (play A0), the opponent has no incentive to cooperate \u2014 because A1 is strictly dominant for them.\n\nSo if we play A0, we get 0 if they play A1 (which they likely will), which is worse than playing A1 and getting 1.\n\nTherefore, the best response is to play A1 with 100% probability.\n\n### Step 3: Output format\n\nWe must output a JSON with A0 and A1 as keys, values as integers from 0 to 100 summing to 100.\n\nSince A1 is strictly dominant and the opponent is likely to continue playing A1 (as it\u2019s their dominant strategy), we should play A1 with probability 100%.\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma. The payoff matrix shows:\n- Mutual cooperation (A0,A0) gives (2,2)\n- Mutual defection (A1,A1) gives (1,1)\n- If one cooperates (A0) and the other defects (A1), the defector gets 3 and the cooperator gets 0.\n\nIn Round 3, both players chose \"D\" (which likely corresponds to A1, the defection action). So the outcome was (A1,A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nGiven that this is a repetitive game and past actions are visible, we need to consider the opponent's behavior. The opponent (qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)) chose D (A1) in the last round.\n\nTo maximize my score, I should think about how to respond. Since the opponent defected last round, I might want to punish them by defecting as well, to avoid being exploited. However, if I always defect, we both get low payoffs (1,1). Alternatively, I could try to encourage cooperation by sometimes cooperating.\n\nBut note: the opponent is also a reasoning agent. They might be playing a tit-for-tat strategy (copying my previous move) or some other strategy.\n\nIn Round 3, I chose D (A1) and they chose D (A1). So if they are playing tit-for-tat, they would copy my last move (D). If I want to shift to cooperation, I might need to cooperate first.\n\nHowever, if I cooperate (A0) and they defect (A1), I get 0 which is bad. So I need to be cautious.\n\nGiven that we both defected last round, the safe choice is to defect again to get at least 1. But if I cooperate and they also cooperate, we both get 2 which is better.\n\nSince the opponent is likely to be rational, they might think similarly. To signal willingness to cooperate, I might choose a mixed strategy that leans towards cooperation but with some defense.\n\nA common approach in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma is to use a \"generous tit-for-tat\": mostly copy the opponent's last move, but sometimes cooperate even after defection to restore cooperation.\n\nIn this case, since both defected last round, I should defect with high probability but with a small chance to cooperate.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the Nash equilibrium for the one-shot game. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for Prisoner's Dilemma is to defect with probability 1, but that gives poor payoffs in repetition.\n\nFor the one-shot game:\nLet p be my probability for A0 (cooperate), and q be opponent's probability for A0.\n\nMy expected payoff: \nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n= 2pq + 3q(1-p) + (1-p)(1-q)\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + (3q - q) + 1 - p\n= 0 + 2q + 1 - p\n\nTo maximize given q, I should set p=0 if 2q+1-p is decreasing in p (which it is). So best response is always defect (p=0) for any q. Similarly for opponent.\n\nSo the dominant strategy is to always defect. But in repetition, we can do better.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected last round, and I defected, they might defect again. So I should defect to avoid being exploited.\n\nHowever, to break the cycle, I might try a small probability of cooperation.\n\nGiven that it's round 4, and we have history, I'll choose a strategy that defects with high probability but has a small chance to cooperate.\n\nSay, defect with 90%, cooperate with 10%. This way, I mostly protect myself, but occasionally offer cooperation.\n\nIf the opponent is reasoning, they might reciprocate.\n\nSo for this round, I'll choose A1 with 90, A0 with 10.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 10, \"A1\": 90}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a repeated game with the following payoff matrix (for me, the row player):\n\n```\n                Opponent\n                A0    A1\nMe      A0       2     0\n        A1       3     1\n```\n\nThis is a 2-player, 2-action simultaneous game. We are in Round 3, and we know that in previous rounds, both players (including the opponent, deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)) chose \"D\" \u2014 which likely stands for \"Determine\" or \"Decided\" \u2014 but in context, since the actions are A0 and A1, and the note says \"your chosen action will be visible\", it's likely that \"D\" is shorthand for the action they took in prior rounds.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the actions are A0 and A1. So what does \"D\" mean?\n\nLooking at the note:  \n> Round 3: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\n\nThis is likely indicating the *previous choices* made by each player in Round 1 and Round 2. Since we are in Round 3, and the game is repeated, we can infer that both players chose the same action in prior rounds \u2014 and \"D\" probably stands for a specific action.\n\nBut which one? A0 or A1?\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the payoffs.\n\nIf both players always chose A0: payoff = (2,2)  \nIf both always chose A1: payoff = (1,1)  \nIf one chose A0 and the other A1: asymmetric payoffs (0,3) or (3,0)\n\nThe most stable outcome in a one-shot game is the Nash equilibrium.\n\nLet\u2019s find the Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.\n\nLet p = probability I play A0  \nLet q = probability opponent plays A0\n\nMy expected payoff if I play A0:  \nE[A0] = 2q + 0(1\u2212q) = 2q\n\nMy expected payoff if I play A1:  \nE[A1] = 3q + 1(1\u2212q) = 3q + 1 \u2212 q = 2q + 1\n\nSo E[A1] \u2212 E[A0] = (2q + 1) \u2212 2q = 1 > 0\n\nThat means, no matter what q is, E[A1] > E[A0] by exactly 1.\n\nSo I always prefer A1 over A0, regardless of opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\nSimilarly, let\u2019s check from opponent\u2019s perspective.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff:\n\nIf opponent plays A0:  \nE[A0] = 2p + 3(1\u2212p) = 2p + 3 \u2212 3p = 3 \u2212 p\n\nIf opponent plays A1:  \nE[A1] = 0p + 1(1\u2212p) = 1 \u2212 p\n\nSo E[A0] \u2212 E[A1] = (3 \u2212 p) \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) = 2 > 0\n\nSo opponent always prefers A0 over A1, regardless of my strategy.\n\nWait \u2014 this is interesting.\n\nI (row player) always prefer A1 (because 3 > 2 and 1 > 0 \u2014 A1 dominates A0 for me).\n\nOpponent (column player) always prefers A0 (because 2 > 0 and 3 > 1 \u2014 A0 dominates A1 for opponent).\n\nSo we have a dominance relationship:\n\n- My dominant strategy: A1  \n- Opponent\u2019s dominant strategy: A0\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A0), yielding payoffs (3, 0)\n\nBut wait \u2014 in the previous rounds, both players chose \"D\". If \"D\" means they both chose the same action, then perhaps they both chose A0? Or both A1?\n\nBut if opponent has a dominant strategy to play A0, and I have a dominant strategy to play A1, then in equilibrium we should play (A1, A0).\n\nBut if in previous rounds both played the same action, that suggests they might be coordinating or cooperating \u2014 perhaps they played (A0, A0) for mutual benefit (2,2), which is better for me than (3,0) if I could get 2 instead of 3? No \u2014 3 > 2, so I prefer (3,0) over (2,2). But (3,0) is bad for opponent.\n\nOpponent prefers (2,2) over (3,0) \u2014 because 2 > 0.\n\nSo opponent might be trying to get me to play A0 so they can get 2 instead of 0.\n\nBut I have no incentive to play A0 \u2014 A1 always gives me 1 more point than A0, no matter what.\n\nSo why did both players play \"D\" in previous rounds? Perhaps \"D\" means they both played A0? That would be a cooperative outcome \u2014 but it\u2019s not stable, because I have incentive to deviate to A1.\n\nIf in Round 1 and 2, both played A0, then I got 2 each time. But if I switch to A1 in Round 3, and opponent still plays A0, I get 3 \u2014 better for me.\n\nBut opponent, seeing that I might switch, might now switch to A1 to avoid giving me 3? But if opponent switches to A1, and I play A1, we get (1,1) \u2014 which is worse for opponent than (2,2), and worse than (0,3) if I play A0.\n\nBut opponent\u2019s dominant strategy is A0 \u2014 so they should stick to A0.\n\nSo the rational play for me is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nWhy? Because A1 strictly dominates A0 for me.\n\nNo matter what the opponent does, I get 1 more point by playing A1.\n\nSo I should play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nThe opponent, if rational, will play A0 with 100% probability.\n\nSo the outcome will be (A1, A0) \u2192 I get 3 points.\n\nEven if opponent tries to punish me by playing A1, I still get 1 point \u2014 which is better than 0 if I had played A0.\n\nSo my best response is always A1.\n\nTherefore, I will choose:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nThis is a repeated game with a payoff matrix that resembles a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma.

However, this is a repeated game (round 4), and past actions are visible.\n\nGiven the note: \"Round 4: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\"\n\nThis indicates that in the previous round (round 3), both players chose \"D\" (which likely corresponds to A1, defection).

If both always defect, we get (1,1) every round, which is worse than mutual cooperation (2,2). So there might be an incentive to try to cooperate.\n\nHowever, if I try to cooperate (choose A0) and opponent defects (A1), I get 0 which is bad. So I need to be cautious.\n\nGiven that both defected last round, the opponent might be playing always defect, or Tit-for-Tat, or something else.\n\nSince it's round 4, and we have history, I should consider the pattern.\n\nPrevious rounds: round 3 both defected. What about round 2 and round 1? The note only shows round 3, but since it says \"repetitive\" and \"visible\", I should assume that all past actions are known.\n\nBut the note only provides round 3: both D. For earlier rounds, I don't have data. So I have to make an assumption.\n\nPerhaps the opponent is playing Grim Trigger: cooperate until someone defects, then defect forever. But since we both defected in round 3, if that was the first defection, then we might be stuck in defection.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be playing Tit-for-Tat.\n\nTo maximize my score, I might want to try to revert to cooperation if possible.\n\nBut if I cooperate and opponent defects, I lose.\n\nSo a safe strategy is to defect with high probability.\n\nHowever, to encourage cooperation, I might choose a mixed strategy with some probability of cooperation.\n\nFor example, I could choose to cooperate with a small probability to signal willingness to cooperate, but mostly defect to protect myself.\n\nSince it's round 4, and if there are more rounds, building cooperation might be beneficial.\n\nBut the number of rounds is not specified, so I should assume it's indefinite.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, a reasonable approach is to use a strategy that is responsive.\n\nSince both defected last round, I should defect with high probability, but leave a small chance for cooperation.\n\nFor instance, I could choose 90% A1 and 10% A0.\n\nThis way, if opponent is also mixing, I might occasionally get mutual cooperation.\n\nBut if opponent is always defect, I mostly protect myself.\n\nAnother idea: if I believe the opponent is playing Tit-for-Tat, then if I cooperate, they will cooperate next round? But for this round, if I cooperate and they defect, I get 0.\n\nSo it's risky.\n\nGiven the history of both defecting in round 3, it's likely that opponent will defect again.\n\nTherefore, I should defect with high probability.\n\nI'll choose a probability that is mostly defect, but not 100%, to allow for possible cooperation.\n\nLet me set: A1: 90%, A0: 10%.\n\nSo in JSON: {\"A0\": 10, \"A1\": 90}\n\nThis sums to 100.\n\nFinal answer.\n```json\n{\"A0\": 10, \"A1\": 90}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a repeated game with the following payoff matrix (for me, the row player):\n\n```\n                Opponent\n                A0     A1\nMe     A0        2,2    0,3\n       A1        3,0    1,1\n```\n\nThis is a classic 2-player, 2-action game \u2014 similar to a variant of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma or Chicken game.\n\nLet me analyze the game structure:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Nash Equilibria\n\nWe look for pure strategy Nash equilibria:\n\n- (A0, A0): I get 2, opponent gets 2.  \n  - If I deviate to A1, I get 3 > 2 \u2192 I want to deviate \u2192 Not equilibrium.\n\n- (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3.  \n  - I want to switch to A1 \u2192 get 1 > 0 \u2192 I deviate.  \n  - Opponent wants to switch to A0 \u2192 get 2 > 3? No, 2 < 3 \u2192 opponent doesn\u2019t want to deviate.  \n  \u2192 But I do deviate \u2192 Not equilibrium.\n\n- (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0.  \n  - I have no incentive to switch (switching to A0 gives 2 < 3).  \n  - Opponent: if switches to A1, gets 1 > 0 \u2192 opponent wants to deviate.  \n  \u2192 Not equilibrium.\n\n- (A1, A1): I get 1, opponent gets 1.  \n  - If I switch to A0: I get 0 < 1 \u2192 don\u2019t want to switch.  \n  - Opponent: if switches to A0, gets 0 < 1 \u2192 doesn\u2019t want to switch.  \n  \u2192 So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium!\n\nWait \u2014 but earlier (A1, A0) gives me 3, which is better for me. Why isn\u2019t that an equilibrium?\n\nBecause in (A1, A0), the opponent gets 0, and they can improve by switching to A1 (getting 1 instead of 0). So opponent will deviate.\n\nSo the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoff (1,1).\n\nBut there\u2019s also a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\n### Step 2: Find Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium\n\nLet me find the mixed strategy where I randomize between A0 and A1, and the opponent is indifferent.\n\nLet p = probability I play A0 \u2192 (1-p) = probability I play A1.\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff for playing A0:\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff for playing A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet them equal for opponent to be indifferent:\n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 Impossible.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, I think I confused the perspective.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet q = probability that OPPONENT plays A0 \u2192 (1-q) = probability opponent plays A1.\n\nThen my expected payoff:\n\nIf I play A0:  \n= q * 2 + (1-q) * 0 = 2q\n\nIf I play A1:  \n= q * 3 + (1-q) * 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nFor me to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\n2q = 2q + 1 \u2192 again 0 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nWait \u2014 this suggests that I *always* prefer A1, regardless of q.\n\nBecause 2q + 1 > 2q for all q.\n\nSo my expected payoff for A1 is always 1 point higher than for A0.\n\nTherefore, **A1 strictly dominates A0** for me.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n- If opponent plays A0: A1 gives 3 > 2 \u2192 better\n- If opponent plays A1: A1 gives 1 > 0 \u2192 better\n\nSo no matter what the opponent does, I am always better off playing A1.\n\nTherefore, **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy** for me.\n\nSimilarly, let\u2019s check for the opponent:\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\nIf I play A0: opponent gets 2 (if plays A0) or 3 (if plays A1) \u2192 prefers A1  \nIf I play A1: opponent gets 0 (if plays A0) or 1 (if plays A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n\nSo A1 is also strictly dominant for the opponent.\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is both players playing A1 with probability 1.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the history\n\nThe note says: \u201cRound 4: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\u201d\n\nThis suggests that in previous rounds, both players have been playing \u201cD\u201d \u2014 which likely stands for \u201cDefect\u201d or A1 (since A1 gives higher payoff when opponent cooperates, and is dominant).\n\nSo the opponent has been playing A1 in prior rounds.\n\nGiven that A1 is strictly dominant, and the opponent has been playing A1, there is no incentive for me to deviate.\n\nEven if I try to cooperate (play A0), I get 0 instead of 1 \u2014 worse.\n\nSo the rational, payoff-maximizing choice is to play A1 with 100% probability.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nI should choose:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nThis maximizes my expected payoff regardless of opponent\u2019s strategy, and aligns with the dominant strategy and observed behavior.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a mixed strategy (probability distribution over A0 and A1) that maximizes our expected payoff, given that the opponent is also choosing a mixed strategy. Since the game is symmetric and repetitive, we should consider what strategy the opponent might be using.\n\nFrom the note: \"Round 5: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\". Here \"D\" likely stands for \"Defect\", which in this context probably means choosing A1 (which gives higher payoff if opponent chooses A0, but lower mutual payoff). So both players defected (chose A1) in round 5.\n\nGiven that both defected in the last round, we need to think about what the opponent might do next. However, since we are to choose a mixed strategy independently (without knowing the opponent's current choice), we should compute the Nash Equilibrium for the one-shot game.\n\nLet:\n- p = probability we choose A0\n- q = probability opponent chooses A0\n\nOur expected payoff:\nU = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait, let me recalculate carefully:\nU = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p)*[3q + 1*(1-q)]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p)*[3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + (2q+1) - p*(2q+1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = (2q + 1) - p\n\nSo U = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nThis is interesting: our payoff decreases with our own p (probability of A0) and increases with opponent's q (probability of A0). So to maximize U, we want to minimize p (i.e., choose A1 with high probability) and hope opponent chooses high q.\n\nBut the opponent has symmetric payoffs. Similarly, opponent's expected payoff is:\nV = q * [2p + 0*(1-p)] + (1-q)*[3p + 1*(1-p)]\n  = 2pq + (1-q)*(3p + 1 - p)\n  = 2pq + (1-q)*(2p+1)\n  = 2pq + 2p+1 - 2pq - q\n  = 2p + 1 - q\n\nSo V = 2p + 1 - q.\n\nThe opponent wants to minimize q (to maximize V) and hope we choose high p.\n\nThis suggests that both players have an incentive to choose low probability for A0 (i.e., defect). In fact, A1 is a dominant strategy? Let's check:\n\nIf opponent chooses A0:\n- We get 2 for A0, 3 for A1 -> better to choose A1.\nIf opponent chooses A1:\n- We get 0 for A0, 1 for A1 -> better to choose A1.\n\nSo indeed, A1 strictly dominates A0. Therefore, the only Nash equilibrium is for both to choose A1 with probability 1.\n\nBut in the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we set the opponent indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nFor the opponent to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\nPayoff for opponent choosing A0: 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p\nPayoff for opponent choosing A1: 0*p + 1*(1-p) = 1-p\nSet equal: 2p = 1-p => 3p=1 => p=1/3.\n\nSimilarly, for us to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\nPayoff for us choosing A0: 2q\nPayoff for us choosing A1: 3q + 1*(1-q) = 2q+1\nSet equal: 2q = 2q+1 => 0=1, which is impossible.\n\nThis confirms that there is no mixed strategy that makes us indifferent; we always prefer A1. So the pure strategy of A1 is strictly dominant.\n\nTherefore, the best response is to always choose A1 (i.e., probability 0 for A0, 100 for A1).\n\nGiven that in the last round both defected (chose A1), it is consistent.\n\nSo we should choose A1 with probability 100.\n\nThus, the probability distribution is: A0:0, A1:100.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a repeated game with the following payoff matrix (for me, the row player):\n\n```\n                Opponent\n                A0     A1\nMe      A0      2,2    0,3\n        A1      3,0    1,1\n```\n\nThis is a 2x2 simultaneous-move game. I need to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (as percentages summing to 100).\n\nFirst, let\u2019s analyze the game structure.\n\nThis is similar to a \"Battle of the Sexes\" or \"Chicken\" game, but let\u2019s check for Nash equilibria.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria\n\nCheck each pure strategy profile:\n\n1. (A0, A0): I get 2, opponent gets 2.\n   - If I deviate to A1: I get 3 > 2 \u2192 I want to deviate \u2192 Not Nash.\n\n2. (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3.\n   - I want to switch to A1: I get 1 > 0 \u2192 I want to deviate.\n   - Opponent wants to switch to A0: they get 2 < 3 \u2192 they don\u2019t want to deviate.\n   \u2192 Not Nash (I want to deviate).\n\n3. (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0.\n   - I don\u2019t want to deviate (switching to A0 gives 2 < 3).\n   - Opponent wants to switch to A1: they get 1 > 0 \u2192 they want to deviate.\n   \u2192 Not Nash.\n\n4. (A1, A1): I get 1, opponent gets 1.\n   - I deviate to A0: I get 0 < 1 \u2192 don\u2019t want to deviate.\n   - Opponent deviates to A0: they get 0 < 1 \u2192 don\u2019t want to deviate.\n   \u2192 This IS a Nash equilibrium!\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s surprising. Let me double-check:\n\nAt (A1, A1): both get 1.\n\nIf I switch to A0: I get 0 (worse).  \nIf opponent switches to A0: they get 0 (worse).\n\nSo yes \u2014 (A1, A1) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut what about (A0, A0)?  \nAt (A0, A0): I get 2.  \nIf I switch to A1: I get 3 > 2 \u2192 so I have incentive to deviate.  \nSo (A0, A0) is NOT Nash.\n\nSo the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1).\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium?\n\n### Step 2: Find Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium\n\nLet me find the mixed strategy where I randomize so that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nLet p = probability I play A0 \u2192 then (1-p) = probability I play A1.\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff for playing A0:\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff for playing A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet them equal for indifference:\n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nThat can\u2019t be. So there is no mixed strategy where opponent is indifferent? That suggests something is wrong.\n\nWait \u2014 I think I confused the payoffs.\n\nActually, in mixed strategy equilibrium, I need to choose my p so that the OPPONENT is indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\n- If opponent plays A0: they get 2 if I play A0, 0 if I play A1 \u2192 so E[payoff] = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n- If opponent plays A1: they get 3 if I play A0, 1 if I play A1 \u2192 so E[payoff] = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo opponent\u2019s payoff for A1 is always 1 more than for A0, regardless of p.\n\nSo opponent always prefers A1 \u2014 because 2p + 1 > 2p for all p.\n\nTherefore, opponent\u2019s best response is always to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nSimilarly, if opponent always plays A1, what is my best response?\n\nIf opponent plays A1:\n- I play A0 \u2192 I get 0\n- I play A1 \u2192 I get 1\n\nSo I prefer A1.\n\nThus, the only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) \u2014 pure strategy.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the history\n\nThe note says: \u201cRound 5: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\u201d\n\nThis suggests that in previous rounds, both players have been playing \u201cD\u201d \u2014 which likely stands for \u201cDefect\u201d or in this context, since actions are A0 and A1, \u201cD\u201d probably means A1 (since A1 gives higher payoff when opponent plays A1, and is the Nash equilibrium).\n\nSo both players have been playing A1 in previous rounds.\n\nThis reinforces the idea that A1 is the focal point.\n\nMoreover, since this is a repeated game and actions are visible, there is incentive to continue cooperating (in the sense of playing the Nash equilibrium) to avoid punishment.\n\nIf I deviate to A0 while opponent plays A1, I get 0 instead of 1 \u2014 a loss.\n\nIf opponent deviates to A0 while I play A1, they get 0 instead of 1 \u2014 but they have no incentive to do so, since A1 is strictly dominant for them.\n\nWait \u2014 is A1 strictly dominant for the opponent?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\nFor opponent:\n- If I play A0: opponent gets 2 (if they play A0) vs 3 (if they play A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n- If I play A1: opponent gets 0 (if they play A0) vs 1 (if they play A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n\nSo yes \u2014 A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for the opponent!\n\nSimilarly, for me:\n- If opponent plays A0: I get 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) \u2192 prefer A1\n- If opponent plays A1: I get 0 (A0) vs 1 (A1) \u2192 prefer A1\n\nSo A1 is also a strictly dominant strategy for me!\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth players have a strictly dominant strategy: A1.\n\nTherefore, regardless of what the opponent does, the best response is always A1.\n\nThe unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), and it\u2019s also the dominant strategy equilibrium.\n\nIn repeated play, with history showing both players have been playing A1 (D), there is no incentive to deviate.\n\nDeviation to A0 would reduce my payoff from 1 to 0 if opponent continues A1.\n\nSo I should play A1 with probability 100%.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from my perspective):\n\n| My \\ Opp | A0     | A1     |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| A0       | 2      | 0      |\n| A1       | 3      | 1      |\n\nAnd from the opponent's perspective (since it's symmetric):\n\n| Opp \\ My | A0     | A1     |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| A0       | 2      | 0      |\n| A1       | 3      | 1      |\n\nThis is similar to a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma. Note that:\n- If I choose A1, I get at least 1 point, but if I choose A0, I might get 0.\n- However, if both choose A0, we both get 2 (which is better than both choosing A1 giving 1 each).\n- But A1 is a dominant strategy for me: \n  - If opponent chooses A0: I get 3 with A1 vs 2 with A0 -> better to choose A1.\n  - If opponent chooses A1: I get 1 with A1 vs 0 with A0 -> better to choose A1.\n\nSo regardless of what the opponent does, I get a higher payoff by choosing A1. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nHowever, we are asked to choose a probability distribution. Since A1 is strictly dominant, I should choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nBut note: the game is repetitive and previous moves are visible. In round 6, we see that both players chose \"D\" in the previous round? Wait, the note says: \"Round 6: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\". What does \"D\" mean? The actions are A0 and A1, not D. Perhaps \"D\" stands for \"Defect\" which is A1? And \"C\" for Cooperate which is A0? That makes sense in the context of Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\nSo in round 6, both players defected (chose A1). So the history is that both defected.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected last round, and since defection is the dominant strategy, it is rational to defect again. There is no incentive to cooperate (A0) because if I cooperate and opponent defects, I get 0.

No incentive for them to switch.\n\nMoreover, in many AI agents, especially in repeated games, \u201calways defect\u201d is a common default if no cooperation is established.\n\nWe have no history of cooperation \u2014 Round 6 was mutual defection.\n\nSo the most rational, risk-averse strategy is to **continue defecting**.\n\nBut we are allowed to play a **mixed strategy**.\n\nWe can randomize.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose we play A0 with probability p, A1 with probability 1-p.\n\nWe want to choose p to maximize our expected payoff, assuming the opponent will play A1 again (since they did last round).\n\nIf opponent plays A1 with probability 1 (i.e., always defects), then:\n\nMy expected payoff = p * 0 + (1-p) * 1 = 1 - p\n\nTo maximize this, we set p = 0 \u2192 always play A1 \u2192 get 1.\n\nIf we think opponent might play A0 with some probability q, then:\n\nE = 2q - p + 1 (from earlier)\n\nBut we don\u2019t know q.\n\nSince we have no reason to believe q > 0, and we saw them play A1 last round, the best estimate is q = 0.\n\nSo E = 0 - p + 1 = 1 - p \u2192 maximize by p=0.\n\nThus, optimal is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if we try to trigger cooperation?\n\nSuppose we play A0 with small probability, say 10%, to test if opponent is cooperative.\n\nIf they play A0, we get 2 \u2014 great.\n\nIf they play A1, we get 0 \u2014 bad, but only 10% of the time.\n\nExpected payoff if opponent plays A1 always: 0.1*0 + 0.9*1 = 0.9 < 1 \u2192 worse than always defecting.\n\nSo even a small chance of cooperation doesn\u2019t help if opponent is always defecting.\n\nOnly if opponent has a significant chance of cooperating (q > 0.5), then playing A0 becomes better.\n\nBut we have no evidence of that.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider: what if the opponent is playing a strategy that rewards cooperation?\n\nWe don\u2019t know.\n\nBut in the absence of evidence of cooperation, and given that mutual defection is the Nash equilibrium, and we are trying to maximize our own score (not necessarily to be fair or cooperative), the rational choice is to **defect**.\n\nMoreover, in repeated games with unknown opponents, \u201calways defect\u201d is a safe, unexploitable strategy.\n\nSo I will choose:\n\nA0: 0%\nA1: 100%\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma.

Looking at the history:\nRound 7: Both players defected (D means A1).\n\nGiven that both defected last round, this suggests a pattern of mutual defection. In repeated games, players might use strategies like Tit-for-Tat (start with cooperate, then mirror opponent's last move). But here, both defected last round.\n\nIf I assume my opponent is playing Tit-for-Tat, they would play whatever I played last round. Last round I defected (A1), so they would defect this round. Similarly, if they are grim trigger, they might defect forever after one defection.\n\nTo maximize my score, I need to consider what the opponent might do. Since they defected last round and I defected, they might expect me to defect again. If I cooperate (A0) and they defect (A1), I get 0 (sucker's payoff). If I defect and they defect, I get 1.\n\nThe safe move is to defect, ensuring at least 1. If I cooperate, I risk getting 0.\n\nBut perhaps there is a chance to revert to cooperation. However, given that it's round 7 and both defected last round, it might be hard to re-establish trust.\n\nLet me think about the opponent: qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT). They are also an AI, likely rational. In repeated PD, the equilibrium can involve mixed strategies, but without clear communication, mutual defection is stable.\n\nTo maximize my expected payoff, I should calculate the best response. Suppose I assign probability p to A0 (cooperate) and (1-p) to A1 (defect).\n\nIf opponent defects with probability q (so cooperate with 1-q), my expected payoff is:\nE = p[ (1-q)*2 + q*0 ] + (1-p)[ (1-q)*3 + q*1 ]\n  = p[2(1-q)] + (1-p)[3(1-q) + q]\n  = 2p(1-q) + (1-p)(3 - 3q + q)\n  = 2p - 2pq + (1-p)(3 - 2q)\n  = 2p - 2pq + 3 - 2q - 3p + 2pq\n  = (2p - 3p) + (-2pq + 2pq) + 3 - 2q\n  = -p + 3 - 2q\n\nSo E = 3 - 2q - p\n\nTo maximize this, since p has a negative coefficient, I should set p=0 (always defect) regardless of q. This confirms that defecting is dominant.\n\nEven in repeated games, if the opponent is not using a forgiving strategy, defecting might be best.\n\nGiven that last round both defected, it is likely that the opponent will defect again.

Looking at the history:\nRound 8: both players defected (D means defect, which is A1).\n\nGiven that both defected last round, and considering the repetitive nature, we need to think about strategies.\n\nCommon strategies in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma:\n1. Always defect: maximizes short-term but leads to mutual defection.\n2. Tit-for-tat: start with cooperate, then mirror opponent's last move.\n\nSince both defected last round, tit-for-tat would defect this round. But we are at round 8, which might be near the end (if fixed number of rounds), so there might be incentive to defect in last rounds.\n\nHowever, the note says \"this game is repetitive\", implying it continues, but we don't know the total number of rounds. So we should assume it might continue indefinitely, making cooperation possible.\n\nBut in round 8, both just defected. So if we follow tit-for-tat, we should defect again.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to revert to cooperation to avoid mutual defection, but since opponent just defected, they might not cooperate.\n\nGiven the symmetry, the Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies for one-shot is to defect with probability 100%? Actually, let's compute the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nLet p be probability we choose A0 (cooperate), and q be probability opponent chooses A0.\n\nOur expected payoff: \nU = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n= 2pq + 3q(1-p) + (1-p)(1-q)\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q - q + 1 - p\n= 0 + 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo U = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSimilarly, opponent's payoff is symmetric.\n\nTo find Nash equilibrium, we maximize U wrt p, given q.\n\nSince U is linear in p: U = (2q + 1) - p\nTo maximize, we set p=0 if coefficient of p is negative? Here coefficient is -1, always negative, so we should set p as low as possible, i.e., p=0.\n\nSo regardless of what opponent does, we should always defect (p=0) in one-shot. So the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is pure defect.\n\nTherefore, in every round, the best response is to defect, even in repeated game if there is no future punishment.\n\nBut in repeated game, if we defect, opponent might defect in future. However, since both defected last round, and if we defect again, it might continue.\n\nBut if we cooperate, opponent might take advantage.\n\nGiven that both defected last round, and the one-shot best response is to defect, we should defect again.\n\nSo choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nThus, {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **me** (the row player) is:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2\n- (A0, A1): 0\n- (A1, A0): 3\n- (A1, A1): 1\n\nThis is a classic 2x2 game.

If opponent switches to A1, they get 1 > 0 \u2192 they want to deviate \u2192 Not Nash.\n\nSo the **only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**, giving both players 1 point.\n\nBut wait \u2014 (A0, A0) gives 2 each, which is better for both! Why isn\u2019t that a Nash equilibrium?\n\nBecause each player has an incentive to deviate: if I play A0 and you play A0, I can get 3 by switching to A1 (while you stay at A0). So (A0, A0) is **Pareto efficient** but **not stable**.\n\nSo in a one-shot game, the only stable outcome is (A1, A1). But this is a **repeated game**, and we can use history to coordinate.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the history\n\nThe note says:  \n> Round 8: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\n\nWait \u2014 what does \"D\" mean? The actions are A0 and A1. But the note says \"D\" for both players.\n\nThis is likely a **mislabeling** or shorthand. In many games, \"D\" stands for \"Defect\", and \"C\" for \"Cooperate\".\n\nLooking at the payoffs:\n\n- If both play A0 \u2192 both get 2 \u2192 this looks like **Cooperate** (mutual benefit)\n- If I play A1 and opponent A0 \u2192 I get 3, they get 0 \u2192 this is **Defect** against Cooperate\n- If both play A1 \u2192 both get 1 \u2192 this is **Mutual Defect**\n\nSo this is **exactly the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma**!\n\nLet me map:\n\n- A0 = Cooperate (C)\n- A1 = Defect (D)\n\nPayoffs:\n\n- (C,C): 2,2 \u2192 mutual cooperation\n- (C,D): 0,3 \u2192 sucker, temptation\n- (D,C): 3,0 \u2192 temptation, sucker\n- (D,D): 1,1 \u2192 mutual defection\n\nYes! This is the classic Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma with payoffs: T=3, R=2, P=1, S=0.\n\nIn one-shot PD, the only Nash is (D,D). But in repeated games, cooperation can be sustained via strategies like Tit-for-Tat.\n\n### Step 3: What happened in Round 8?\n\nThe note says:  \n> Round 8: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\n\nSo both players played D (i.e., A1) in Round 8.\n\nThat means the previous round ended in mutual defection.\n\nNow we are at Round 9 (I assume \u2014 the next round).\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.\n\nWe want to **maximize our long-term score**.\n\n### Step 4: Strategy in Repeated PD\n\nIn repeated PD, the best response depends on the opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\nWe know the opponent in Round 8 played D.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know their overall strategy.\n\nHowever, since both players are AI models using CoT (Chain-of-Thought), they are likely to be sophisticated and possibly using cooperative strategies if they believe in reciprocity.\n\nBut in Round 8, both defected. That suggests either:\n\n- They are both playing Nash (always defect), or\n- They are responding to prior defection (e.g., Tit-for-Tat), or\n- They are confused or misaligned.\n\nGiven that both played D in Round 8, and assuming the opponent is using a simple strategy like Tit-for-Tat, then they might have been provoked by our previous move.\n\nBut we don\u2019t have history before Round 8.\n\nWe only know Round 8: both played D.\n\nSo the most recent interaction was mutual defection.\n\nIn such a case, if we want to **re-establish cooperation**, we might try playing A0 (C) to signal willingness to cooperate.\n\nBut if the opponent is a constant defector, then playing A0 will get us 0.\n\nIf we play A1, we get 1 (if they also play A1) \u2014 same as before.\n\nSo we have a trade-off:\n\n- Play A0 (C): risk getting 0 if opponent plays D, but if opponent cooperates, we get 2.\n- Play A1 (D): guaranteed 1 if opponent plays D, or 3 if opponent plays C.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\n### Step 5: Game Theory \u2014 Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium\n\nIn a one-shot PD, the only Nash is pure (D,D). But if we consider mixed strategies, is there a mixed Nash?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the opponent plays A0 with probability p, A1 with probability 1-p.\n\nMy expected payoff for playing A0:  \n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nMy expected payoff for playing A1:  \n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nCompare:  \nE[A1] = 2p + 1  \nE[A0] = 2p\n\nSo E[A1] > E[A0] for all p.\n\nTherefore, **no matter what the opponent does, I am always better off playing A1**.\n\nThis is the essence of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma: **Defect is a strictly dominant strategy**.\n\nSo even in mixed strategies, the best response is always to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nEven if the opponent plays A0 99% of the time, I still get:\n\n- A0: 2 * 0.99 = 1.98\n- A1: 3 * 0.99 + 1 * 0.01 = 2.97 + 0.01 = 2.98 > 1.98\n\nSo I still prefer A1.\n\nTherefore, **regardless of opponent\u2019s strategy, A1 (Defect) is strictly dominant**.\n\n### Step 6: Repeated Game Consideration\n\nIn repeated games, cooperation can be sustained if players are patient and use trigger strategies.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: we don\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\nWe only know that in the last round, they played D.\n\nIf they are playing Tit-for-Tat, then they are mirroring our last move. So if we played D in Round 7, they played D in Round 8.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know what we played in Round 7.\n\nThe note says: \u201cRound 8: ... qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): D\u201d\n\nSo we played D in Round 8.\n\nThat means if the opponent is using Tit-for-Tat, they played D in Round 8 because we played D in Round 7.\n\nSo we are in a cycle of mutual defection.\n\nTo break out, we might try cooperating.\n\nBut if we play A0 now, and the opponent is still playing D (because they are a constant defector), we get 0.\n\nIf we play A1, we get 1.\n\nSo the **immediate payoff** is higher for A1.\n\nAnd since we don\u2019t know if the opponent will reciprocate, and since A1 is strictly dominant, **rational self-interest dictates we play A1**.\n\nMoreover, in repeated games with finite rounds, backward induction leads to mutual defection always.\n\nEven if it\u2019s infinite, without a guarantee of reciprocity, defection is the safe choice.\n\n### Step 7: Final Decision\n\nGiven that:\n\n- A1 is strictly dominant in every round.\n- The opponent just defected last round.\n- We have no evidence they will cooperate.\n- We are trying to maximize our own score.\n- There is no mechanism to enforce cooperation.\n\n\u2192 The optimal strategy is to **always play A1**.\n\nSo we choose:\n\n- A0: 0%\n- A1: 100%\n\nThis maximizes our expected payoff regardless of opponent\u2019s action.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from your perspective):\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | 2           | 0           |\n| You A1        | 3           | 1           |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1. Let p be the probability of choosing A0, and (1-p) for A1.\n\nThe opponent's strategy from the previous round was \"D\", which likely stands for \"Defect\" (i.e., A1). However, note that the opponent is also a reasoning agent and might change strategies.\n\nThis is similar to a Prisoner's Dilemma:\n- (A0, A0) gives (2,2) - both cooperate.\n- (A0, A1) gives (0,3) - you cooperate, opponent defects.\n- (A1, A0) gives (3,0) - you defect, opponent cooperates.\n- (A1, A1) gives (1,1) - both defect.\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium in one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma is for both to defect (A1). However, since this is a repeated game (round 9), we need to consider the history.\n\nPrevious round: both chose \"D\" (A1). So the outcome was (1,1).\n\nIn repeated games, players can use strategies like Tit-for-Tat (mimic opponent's previous move) or try to encourage cooperation.\n\nBut note: the opponent in this round is \"qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)\", which is an AI similar to you. It might be using a rational strategy.\n\nLet's compute the expected payoff for you given your mixed strategy (p, 1-p) and assume the opponent has a strategy (q for A0, 1-q for A1).\n\nYour expected payoff = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n= p [2q] + (1-p)[3q + 1 - q]\n= 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n= 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n= 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo your payoff is decreasing in p (your probability to cooperate). To maximize your payoff for this round regardless of the opponent, you should minimize p (i.e., choose p=0, always defect). This gives you at least 1 point and possibly 3 if opponent cooperates.\n\nHowever, in repeated games, if you always defect, the opponent will also defect, leading to (1,1) every time. If both cooperate, you get (2,2) which is better.\n\nBut since it's round 9, and there might be more rounds? The note says \"repetitive\", but we don't know the total number of rounds. If it's finite, the backward induction might lead to defection in all rounds.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected last round (D), if we use Tit-for-Tat, we should defect this round.\n\nBut let's think about the opponent: it also defected last round. It might be playing \"always defect\" or Tit-for-Tat.\n\nIf we cooperate (A0) and opponent defects (A1), we get 0 which is bad.\n\nIf we defect (A1) and opponent cooperates (A0), we get 3.\n\nSince the opponent defected last round, it is likely to defect again if it is using Tit-for-Tat or grim trigger.\n\nTo be safe, we should defect. But we can also try to signal cooperation? However, since it's late (round 9), and if the opponent is rational, it might not cooperate.\n\nGiven the expected payoff formula: 2q + 1 - p, to maximize, we want p=0 (defect) regardless of q.\n\nSo the best is to defect with probability 1.\n\nTherefore, we choose A1 with probability 100.\n\nSo the distribution is {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nBut note: the output must have integers between 0 and 100 that sum to 100.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **me** (the row player) is:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2\n- (A0, A1): 0\n- (A1, A0): 3\n- (A1, A1): 1\n\nThis is a classic **non-zero-sum** game, similar to a coordination game with a temptation to defect.\n\nLet me analyze the game structure:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Nash Equilibria\n\nWe can look for pure strategy Nash equilibria first.\n\n- If opponent plays A0:\n  - My best response: A1 (3 > 2) \u2192 I prefer A1\n- If opponent plays A1:\n  - My best response: A0 (0 < 1) \u2192 I prefer A1 (since 1 > 0)\n\nWait \u2014 correction:\n\nIf opponent plays A0:\n- I get 2 for A0, 3 for A1 \u2192 I prefer A1\n\nIf opponent plays A1:\n- I get 0 for A0, 1 for A1 \u2192 I prefer A1\n\nSo **A1 is a dominant strategy** for me? Let\u2019s check:\n\n- Against A0: A1 gives 3 > 2 \u2192 better\n- Against A1: A1 gives 1 > 0 \u2192 better\n\nYes! **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy** for me.\n\nSimilarly, let\u2019s check for the opponent:\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2\n- (A0, A1): 3\n- (A1, A0): 0\n- (A1, A1): 1\n\nSo if I play A0:\n- Opponent gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n\nIf I play A1:\n- Opponent gets 0 (A0) vs 1 (A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n\nSo **A1 is also a strictly dominant strategy for the opponent**.\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies is **(A1, A1)**, yielding (1,1).\n\nBut wait \u2014 is that the best we can do? (1,1) is worse than (2,2) from (A0,A0). But since both players have a dominant strategy to play A1, we cannot coordinate on (A0,A0) unless we trust each other \u2014 but this is a one-shot simultaneous move game (even though repeated, each round is independent in decision-making).\n\n### Step 2: Consider repeated game implications\n\nThe note says: \u201cThis game is repetitive so your chosen action will be visible to your opponents in future rounds.\u201d\n\nWe are on **Round 9**. The opponent in Round 9 is: `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D`\n\nThe \u201cD\u201d likely stands for \u201cDefect\u201d \u2014 meaning they played A1 in the previous round (since A1 gives 3 to the opponent if you play A0, and is the \u201cdefect\u201d action in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma structure).\n\nThis suggests the opponent has been playing A1 consistently.\n\nIn fact, if the opponent has been playing A1 in all prior rounds, then they are likely continuing to play A1 \u2014 because A1 is dominant.\n\nSo we can reasonably assume the opponent will play A1 again in Round 9.\n\n### Step 3: Best response to opponent playing A1\n\nIf opponent plays A1 with probability 1, then:\n\n- My payoff for A0: 0\n- My payoff for A1: 1\n\nSo I should play A1 to get 1 point instead of 0.\n\nEven if the opponent plays A1 with high probability, say p, then my expected payoff is:\n\nE[A0] = p * 0 + (1-p) * 2 = 2(1-p)  \nE[A1] = p * 1 + (1-p) * 3 = 3 - 2p\n\nSet them equal to find indifference:\n\n2(1-p) = 3 - 2p  \n2 - 2p = 3 - 2p  \n2 = 3 \u2192 contradiction\n\nSo E[A1] - E[A0] = (3 - 2p) - (2 - 2p) = 1 > 0 always.\n\nThus, **A1 always gives 1 more point than A0, regardless of opponent\u2019s probability**.\n\nTherefore, **A1 is strictly dominant**.\n\n### Step 4: Decision\n\nSince A1 is strictly dominant, and the opponent has a history of playing A1 (D), the optimal strategy is to play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nThis gives me 1 point, which is the best I can guarantee.\n\nPlaying any A0 would risk 0 points, and gives no upside.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}]]
[[{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n| You \\ Opponent | A0     | A1     |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| A0             | (2,2)  | (0,3)  |\n| A1             | (3,0)  | (1,1)  |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (i.e., probabilities p for A0 and (1-p) for A1) that maximizes our expected payoff, given that the opponent is also choosing a probability distribution (say q for A0 and (1-q) for A1).\n\nSince the game is symmetric and we are playing without history, we should look for a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.\n\nLet:\n- Your probability for A0 = p, so for A1 = 1-p.\n- Opponent's probability for A0 = q, so for A1 = 1-q.\n\nYour expected payoff U(p, q) is:\nU = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = p * 2q + (1-p) * (2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + (2q+1) - p*(2q+1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo, your expected payoff is: U = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nSimilarly, the opponent's expected payoff V(q, p) is symmetric:\nV = 2p + 1 - q.\n\nIn a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, each player chooses a probability that makes the other indifferent between their actions.\n\nTo find your best response to the opponent's q:\nFrom U = 2q + 1 - p, we see that:\n- If 2q + 1 is constant with respect to p, then to maximize U we should minimize p (since U decreases as p increases). Actually, U is decreasing in p for any fixed q. So to maximize U, we should set p as low as possible (i.e., p=0) if we can.\n\nBut wait, let's check the derivative with respect to p: dU/dp = -1 < 0. So indeed, for any fixed q, your payoff is strictly decreasing in p. Therefore, you always prefer to set p as low as possible (i.e., always choose A1) regardless of what the opponent does.\n\nSimilarly, for the opponent: their payoff V = 2p + 1 - q is strictly decreasing in q. So they also always prefer to set q as low as possible (i.e., always choose A1).\n\nTherefore, the dominant strategy for both players is to always choose A1. This is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nWhy would anyone choose A0? Actually, if the opponent chooses A0, you get 3 by choosing A1 (which is better than 2 from A0). If the opponent chooses A1, you get 1 by choosing A1 (which is better than 0 from A0). So indeed, A1 strictly dominates A0.\n\nThus, the best strategy is to choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nSo, the probability distribution should be: {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nThis maximizes your score regardless of what the opponent does.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from my perspective):\n\n| My Action | Opponent Action | My Payoff | Opponent Payoff |\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| A0        | A0              | 2         | 2               |\n| A0        | A1              | 0         | 3               |\n| A1        | A0              | 3         | 0               |\n| A1        | A1              | 1         | 1               |\n\nThis is similar to a \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game.

I should assume they are rational and will also play a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nTo find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:\nLet my probability for A0 be p, and opponent's probability for A0 be q.\n\nMy expected payoff if I choose A0:\nE(A0) = q * 2 + (1-q) * 0 = 2q\n\nMy expected payoff if I choose A1:\nE(A1) = q * 3 + (1-q) * 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nFor me to be indifferent between A0 and A1 (so that I can mix), set E(A0) = E(A1):\n2q = 2q + 1  => 0=1, which is impossible.\n\nThis means there is no mixed strategy where I am indifferent. Actually, E(A1) = 2q+1 is always greater than E(A0)=2q by 1. So I always prefer A1 regardless of what the opponent does? But wait, let's check:\n\nIf opponent plays A0 (q=1): E(A0)=2, E(A1)=3 -> prefer A1.\nIf opponent plays A1 (q=0): E(A0)=0, E(A1)=1 -> prefer A1.\n\nSo indeed, A1 strictly dominates A0? Because no matter what the opponent does, I get 1 more point by choosing A1:\n- If opponent A0: A1 gives 3 vs A0 gives 2 -> +1\n- If opponent A1: A1 gives 1 vs A0 gives 0 -> +1\n\nTherefore, I should always choose A1. But wait, if both always choose A1, we both get 1, which is worse than both choosing A0 (which gives 2). However, since the opponent is rational, they should also realize that A1 is strictly better for them. So the Nash equilibrium is both always playing A1.\n\nBut is that Pareto efficient? No, because (A0,A0) gives (2,2) which is better for both. However, without coordination, the dominant strategy is to play A1.\n\nIn a one-shot game, the rational choice is to play A1 with probability 100%. However, since this is repetitive and we might be able to coordinate in future rounds, I might consider playing A0 to signal cooperation.\n\nBut in Round 1, without any history, I should play the dominant strategy.\n\nTherefore, I should choose A1 with 100% probability.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the payoffs:\n- (A0,A0): (2,2)\n- (A0,A1): (0,3)\n- (A1,A0): (3,0)\n- (A1,A1): (1,1)\n\nIndeed, for me:\n- If opponent plays A0: my best response is A1 (3>2)\n- If opponent plays A1: my best response is A1 (1>0)\n\nSo A1 is strictly dominant.\n\nTherefore, I should set probability for A1 to 100.\n\nBut note: the instruction says \"values must be integers between 0 and 100\" and \"sum to exactly 100\". So I need to output a distribution.\n\nSo for me: A0:0, A1:100.\n\nNow, what about the opponent? In Round 1, they are also rational and should play A1 with 100%. So we both get 1.\n\nIn future rounds, if we both always play A1, we get 1 each. But if we can coordinate to both play A0, we get 2. So perhaps I can try to signal by playing A0 in early rounds to encourage cooperation.\n\nHowever, in Round 1, without any information, it might be risky to play A0 because if the opponent plays A1, I get 0.\n\nGiven that the opponent is \"openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)\", which is likely rational, I expect they will play A1. So I should play A1.\n\nBut to build cooperation, I might want to start with a small probability of A0.\n\nActually, in the first round, it is safe to assume the opponent will play the dominant strategy (A1). So I should play A1.\n\nTherefore, for Round 1, I choose A1 with 100%.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma.

However, this is a repeated game (round-based) and past actions are visible.\n\nIn round 1, both players chose D (which corresponds to A1 in this context).

However, since this is repeated, I might want to signal cooperation to try to achieve mutual cooperation (which gives 2) in future rounds.\n\nBut note: the opponent is an AI (gpt-5-nano) that might also be reasoning similarly. Since it defected first, it might be playing \"always defect\". Alternatively, it might be tit-for-tat (which starts with cooperate, but it started with defect here? Actually, round 1 both defected? Wait, the note says \"Round 2: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT): D\". So both defected in round 1.\n\nSo both started with defect. To break out of the mutual defection, I could try cooperating. But if I cooperate and they defect, I get 0 which is worse than 1. So it's risky.\n\nGiven that it's only round 2, and we have more rounds (the game is repetitive), I might try to establish cooperation. However, the opponent is an AI that might be programmed to play optimally.\n\nA common strategy in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma is \"tit-for-tat\": start with cooperate, then do what the opponent did last time. But here both defected in round 1. So if I play tit-for-tat, I should defect again.\n\nBut to maximize long-term payoff, sometimes we need to forgive. However, since the opponent is also an AI, I should assume it is rational.\n\nGiven the risk, I will play it safe and defect again. But to allow for the possibility of cooperation in the future, I might choose a mixed strategy.\n\nActually, the requirement is to choose a probability distribution. So I can randomize.\n\nWhat is the Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies for one-shot?\nLet p be probability I choose A0, and q be probability opponent chooses A0.\n\nMy expected payoff: \nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n = 2pq + 3q(1-p) + (1-p)(1-q)\n = 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq\n = (2pq -3pq +pq) + (3q - q) + 1 - p\n = 0pq + 2q + 1 - p\n = 1 - p + 2q\n\nSimilarly, opponent's payoff is symmetric: 1 - q + 2p.\n\nIn mixed Nash, I am indifferent between actions, so the derivative with respect to p should be zero? Actually, I choose p to maximize given q.\n\nBut for mixed strategy equilibrium, the payoff from A0 and A1 should be equal.\n\nIf I choose A0: payoff = 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\nIf I choose A1: payoff = 3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 1 + 2q\n\nSo A1 always gives 1 more than A0. Therefore, I should always choose A1 (p=0). So the mixed strategy equilibrium is pure defect.\n\nTherefore, the rational choice is to defect with probability 100%.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected in round 1, they are likely to defect again. So I should defect.\n\nThus, I choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nSo the distribution is {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nThis sums to 100.\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from my perspective):\n\n- (A0, A0): I get 2, opponent gets 2\n- (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3\n- (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0\n- (A1, A1): I get 1, opponent gets 1\n\nThis is similar to a \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game. The Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies can be found by making the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n\nLet p be my probability of choosing A0 (so 1-p for A1), and q be the opponent's probability of choosing A0 (so 1-q for A1).\n\nThe opponent's expected payoff for choosing A0:\nIf opponent chooses A0: they get 2 when I choose A0 (prob p), and 0 when I choose A1 (prob 1-p). So: 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p.\n\nThe opponent's expected payoff for choosing A1:\nIf opponent chooses A1: they get 3 when I choose A0 (prob p), and 1 when I choose A1 (prob 1-p). So: 3p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1.\n\nTo make the opponent indifferent, set these equal:\n2p = 2p + 1? This has no solution. Actually, wait: 2p = 2p + 1 implies 0=1, which is impossible. This means there is no mixed strategy that makes the opponent indifferent? Actually, that can't be right.\n\nI made a mistake: the opponent's payoff for A0 is when I choose A0 (they get 2) and when I choose A1 (they get 0). So indeed E[A0] = 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p.\nE[A1] = 3p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1.\n\nSince 2p + 1 > 2p for all p, the opponent always prefers A1 regardless of my strategy. So the opponent should always choose A1.\n\nBut if the opponent always chooses A1, then my best response is to choose A0? Because:\nIf I choose A0 vs A1: I get 0.\nIf I choose A1 vs A1: I get 1.\nSo I should choose A1 to get 1 rather than 0.\n\nBut if I choose A1, then opponent gets 1 (which is worse than if they had chosen A0 against my A1? Actually if opponent had chosen A0 against my A1, they get 0, which is worse than 1). So opponent still prefers A1.\n\nWait, let's check: if opponent always chooses A1, then I should choose A1 to get 1 (since if I choose A0 I get 0). So (A1,A1) is a pure Nash equilibrium: both get 1.\n\nIs there another equilibrium? (A0,A0) gives both 2, which is better, but it is not stable: if I know opponent chooses A0, I can deviate to A1 to get 3 (which is better than 2). Similarly, opponent would deviate.\n\nSo (A1,A1) is the only symmetric Nash equilibrium? Actually, there is also an asymmetric one: one plays A0 and the other A1, but that is not symmetric.\n\nIn mixed strategies: we need to find p such that I am indifferent.\n\nMy expected payoff if I choose A0:\nIf opponent chooses A0 (prob q): I get 2\nIf opponent chooses A1 (prob 1-q): I get 0\nSo E[A0] = 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q.\n\nMy expected payoff if I choose A1:\nIf opponent chooses A0 (prob q): I get 3\nIf opponent chooses A1 (prob 1-q): I get 1\nSo E[A1] = 3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1.\n\nTo make me indifferent: 2q = 2q + 1 -> 0=1, impossible. So no mixed strategy makes me indifferent. I always prefer A1 because E[A1] = 2q+1 > 2q = E[A0] for any q.\n\nTherefore, I should always choose A1.\n\nSimilarly, the opponent should always choose A1.\n\nSo the Nash equilibrium is both playing A1 with probability 1.\n\nNow, in the context of repeated play: we are in round 3. The previous rounds: both played D? But note: actions are A0 and A1, not C and D. Perhaps \"D\" refers to A1? Because in some notations, \"D\" is defect.\n\nAssuming \"D\" means A1 (defect) and \"C\" means A0 (cooperate).\n\nSo round 3: both played D (A1).\n\nGiven that the unique Nash is both playing A1, and in previous rounds both have been playing A1, it makes sense to continue playing A1.\n\nTherefore, I should choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nSo my distribution: A0:0, A1:100.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma. The payoff matrix shows:\n- Mutual cooperation (A0,A0) gives (2,2)\n- You defect while opponent cooperates (A1,A0) gives (3,0) - temptation to defect\n- You cooperate while opponent defects (A0,A1) gives (0,3) - sucker's payoff\n- Mutual defection (A1,A1) gives (1,1)\n\nIn Round 4, both players chose D (which corresponds to A1 in our action set). This means both defected, resulting in (1,1) payoffs.\n\nGiven that this is a repetitive game and past actions are visible, we need to consider strategy. The opponent (openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)) has chosen D (A1) in this round, indicating it might be playing a defection strategy.\n\nHowever, we should note that in Prisoner's Dilemma, the optimal strategy depends on the opponent's behavior. Since we don't have the full history (only round 4 is shown), we must make an assumption.\n\nCommon strategies include:\n1. Always defect: maximizes short-term gain but leads to mutual defection.\n2. Tit-for-tat: start with cooperate, then mirror the opponent's previous move.\n\nIn round 4, both defected. If the opponent is playing tit-for-tat, it would defect again if we defected last time. But since we both defected, it might defect again.\n\nTo maximize our score, we need to encourage cooperation. However, if we always cooperate, we might be exploited.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected in round 4, if we assume it is playing a defection strategy, we should defect to avoid the sucker's payoff (0). But mutual defection gives only 1.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to signal cooperation by sometimes cooperating, but with caution.\n\nSince the game is repetitive, we can try to establish cooperation. But if we cooperate too much, we might be exploited.\n\nLet me calculate the expected payoffs for different probability distributions against an opponent that always defects (since it defected in round 4, and we don't know more).\n\nSuppose the opponent always chooses A1 (defect). Then:\n- If we choose A0 (cooperate) with probability p, and A1 (defect) with probability (1-p).\nOur expected payoff = p * (payoff when we A0, opponent A1) + (1-p) * (payoff when we A1, opponent A1)\n= p * 0 + (1-p) * 1 = 1 - p.\n\nTo maximize this, we should minimize p, i.e., always defect (p=0). This gives payoff 1.\n\nIf we think the opponent might cooperate with some probability, we can adjust.\n\nBut without more information, and given that the opponent defected last round, it is safe to assume it might defect again.\n\nTherefore, to avoid getting 0, we should defect with high probability.\n\nHowever, to leave room for cooperation in future rounds, we might defect with high probability but not 100%, to signal that we can cooperate if they do.\n\nBut strictly for maximizing this round's payoff against a likely defector, we should defect.\n\nBut since it's repetitive, we might want to try to cooperate sometimes to see if they reciprocate.\n\nGiven that this is only round 4, and we have limited history, let's be cautious.\n\nI will choose to defect with high probability, say 90%, and cooperate with 10%, to test the waters.\n\nSo, probability for A1 (defect) = 90, A0 (cooperate) = 10.\n\nThis way, we mostly avoid the sucker's payoff, but occasionally cooperate to encourage reciprocity in future rounds.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 10, \"A1\": 90}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 0, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from my perspective):\n\n- If I choose A0 and opponent chooses A0: I get 2\n- If I choose A0 and opponent chooses A1: I get 0\n- If I choose A1 and opponent chooses A0: I get 3\n- If I choose A1 and opponent chooses A1: I get 1\n\nThe opponent has symmetric payoffs (but from their perspective).\n\nThis is similar to a \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game. The Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies can be found by making the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n\nLet p be the probability that I choose A0 (so 1-p for A1).\nLet q be the probability that the opponent chooses A0 (so 1-q for A1).\n\nFrom the opponent's perspective:\n- If they choose A0: expected payoff = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n- If they choose A1: expected payoff = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nTo make the opponent indifferent, set 2p = 2p + 1? This is impossible because 2p < 2p+1 always. So there is no mixed strategy that makes the opponent indifferent? Actually, wait: that would imply that A1 always gives a higher payoff than A0 for the opponent? But that can't be right because if I always choose A0, then opponent gets 2 for A0 and 3 for A1, so they prefer A1. If I always choose A1, then opponent gets 0 for A0 and 1 for A1, so they still prefer A1. So indeed, for the opponent, A1 strictly dominates A0? Because no matter what I do:\n- If I choose A0: opponent gets 2 for A0 and 3 for A1 -> prefer A1\n- If I choose A1: opponent gets 0 for A0 and 1 for A1 -> prefer A1\n\nSo the opponent should always choose A1. Similarly, from my perspective: if the opponent always chooses A1, then:\n- If I choose A0: I get 0\n- If I choose A1: I get 1\nSo I should always choose A1.\n\nTherefore, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nBut wait, is that the only equilibrium? Actually, (A0, A1) gives me 0 and opponent 3, which is not stable because I would deviate to A1 to get 1. Similarly (A1, A0) gives me 3 and opponent 0, but opponent would deviate to A1 to get 1. So (A1, A1) is the only Nash equilibrium.\n\nHowever, this is a repetitive game and we are in round 5. The history shows that in the previous round, both players chose \"D\" (which might be a code for an action? But in this game, actions are A0 and A1. Perhaps \"D\" stands for \"Dove\" which is A0? And \"H\" for Hawk which is A1? In the standard Hawk-Dove game, Dove (A0) gets 2 when meeting Dove, and Hawk (A1) gets 3 when meeting Dove, etc. So indeed.\n\nIn round 5, it says: \"deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D, openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT): D\". So both chose Dove (A0) last round.\n\nIn a repetitive game, we might be able to sustain cooperation (both choosing Dove) if we both play a tit-for-tat or trigger strategy. But since the opponent is an AI (openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)), we need to model its behavior.\n\nGiven that both cooperated (chose Dove) last round, and we are in round 5, it might be that we are both trying to cooperate. If I defect (choose Hawk/A1) when the opponent cooperates (Dove/A0), I get 3 which is high, but then the opponent might punish me in future rounds.\n\nSince the game is repetitive, the value of cooperation over time is important. But we don't know the number of rounds. However, since it's round 5, there might be more rounds? The problem doesn't specify the total number of rounds.\n\nTo maximize my long-term score, I should cooperate (choose Dove/A0) to sustain cooperation. If I defect, I might get 3 this round but then the opponent might defect in future rounds, leading to (1,1) instead of (2,2).\n\nGiven that the opponent cooperated last round, it is likely to cooperate again if I cooperate. So I should choose Dove (A0) with high probability.\n\nBut to be safe, I might choose a small probability of defection to test, but since it's only round 5 and we have a history of cooperation, it's better to fully cooperate.\n\nTherefore, I should choose A0 with probability 100.\n\nSo the distribution is {\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}\n```"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 3, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from your perspective):\n\n|            | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0     | 2           | 0           |\n| You A1     | 3           | 1           |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1. Let p be the probability we choose A0, and (1-p) for A1.\n\nSimilarly, let q be the probability the opponent chooses A0, and (1-q) for A1.\n\nOur expected payoff is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo, E = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nThis means our payoff depends on the opponent's strategy (q) and our own (p). To maximize our payoff, we want to minimize p (since it has a negative coefficient) regardless of q. The smallest p can be is 0.\n\nTherefore, the best response for us is to set p=0, i.e., always choose A1.\n\nWhy?\n- If opponent chooses A0 (q=1): we get 3 (with A1) which is better than 2 (with A0).\n- If opponent chooses A1 (q=0): we get 1 (with A1) which is better than 0 (with A0).\n\nSo indeed, A1 strictly dominates A0. Therefore, we should always choose A1.\n\nThus, our probability distribution should be {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}.\n\nNote: The history shows Round 6: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): C, openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT): D. But in this game, actions are A0 and A1, not C and D. So perhaps this is a different game? However, based on the payoff matrix provided, the analysis above holds.\n\nGiven that the instructions say \"This game is repetitive\", but since A1 is strictly dominant, there is no reason to ever choose A0.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from my perspective):\n\n| My Action | Opponent Action | My Payoff | Opponent Payoff |\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| A0        | A0              | 2         | 2               |\n| A0        | A1              | 0         | 3               |\n| A1        | A0              | 3         | 0               |\n| A1        | A1              | 1         | 1               |\n\nThis resembles a \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game. The Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies can be found by making the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n\nLet p be the probability I assign to A0 (so 1-p to A1), and let q be the probability the opponent assigns to A0.\n\nMy expected payoff if I choose A0:\nE(A0) = q * 2 + (1-q) * 0 = 2q\n\nMy expected payoff if I choose A1:\nE(A1) = q * 3 + (1-q) * 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nTo make me indifferent between A0 and A1 (so that I have no incentive to deviate), set E(A0) = E(A1):\n2q = 2q + 1 \u2192 0=1, which is impossible. This means there is no mixed strategy that makes me indifferent; actually, E(A1) is always greater than E(A0) by 1. So I should always prefer A1? But wait, let's check.\n\nActually, E(A1) - E(A0) = (2q+1) - 2q = 1, which is always positive. So regardless of what the opponent does, my expected payoff for A1 is always 1 higher than for A0. Therefore, A1 strictly dominates A0? But look at the payoffs: if I choose A1, I get 3 when opponent is A0 (which is better than 2) and 1 when opponent is A1 (which is better than 0). So indeed, A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for me.\n\nSimilarly, from the opponent's perspective, their payoff for A1 is always better: if I choose A0, they get 3 for A1 vs 2 for A0; if I choose A1, they get 1 for A1 vs 0 for A0. So A1 is strictly dominant for both players.\n\nTherefore, the rational choice for both is to always play A1. This leads to the outcome (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nHowever, note that if both cooperate (play A0), they get (2,2) which is better. But since A1 is strictly dominant, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1).\n\nIn the history provided: Round 7: both played D (which probably stands for A1, since A0 is cooperate and A1 is defect). So both have been defecting.\n\nGiven that the opponent is also rational and has a strictly dominant strategy to play A1, I should expect them to play A1 with high probability. Since A1 is dominant, I should play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nBut wait, the instruction requires a probability distribution over actions. Since A1 is strictly dominant, I should assign 100% to A1.\n\nHowever, let me double-check: is there any reason to deviate? Suppose I think the opponent might play A0 with some probability? But even if they play A0 with probability q, my expected payoff for A1 is 3q + 1*(1-q) = 2q+1, and for A0 is 2q + 0*(1-q)=2q. So A1 is always better. So no reason to ever play A0.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to always play A1.\n\nSo my probability distribution should be {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from my perspective):\n\n- If I choose A0 and opponent chooses A0: I get 2, opponent gets 2.\n- If I choose A0 and opponent chooses A1: I get 0, opponent gets 3.\n- If I choose A1 and opponent chooses A0: I get 3, opponent gets 0.\n- If I choose A1 and opponent chooses A1: I get 1, opponent gets 1.\n\nThis is similar to a \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" type game because:\n- Mutual cooperation (A0,A0) gives (2,2) which is good for both.\n- Mutual defection (A1,A1) gives (1,1) which is worse for both.\n- But if one defects and the other cooperates, the defector gets 3 (temptation) and the cooperator gets 0 (sucker's payoff).\n\nIn a one-shot game, the Nash equilibrium is (A1,A1) because defecting (A1) is a dominant strategy: no matter what the opponent does, I get a higher payoff by choosing A1 (if opponent chooses A0: 3 > 2; if opponent chooses A1: 1 > 0). So the rational choice is to always defect.\n\nHowever, this is a repeated game (round 8, and previous rounds are visible). We are told that in the last round (round 7) both players chose \"D\" (which we can assume corresponds to A1, defection). So both defected in the previous round.\n\nIn repeated games, players can use strategies like \"Tit-for-Tat\" (start with cooperate, then mimic the opponent's previous move). But here, since both defected last round, Tit-for-Tat would defect this round.\n\nBut note: we are in round 8. There is no information about how many rounds total, but typically in repeated games, if it is finite and the number of rounds is known, backward induction might lead to defection in all rounds. However, we are not told the total number of rounds.\n\nGiven that the previous round was mutual defection, and if we assume the opponent is also playing a Tit-for-Tat like strategy, then they will defect again this round. So if I defect, I get 1; if I cooperate, I get 0. So defecting is better.\n\nBut perhaps the opponent is using a different strategy. However, without more history, it's hard to know. But since last round both defected, it is safe to assume that the opponent is likely to defect again.\n\nMoreover, since this is a symmetric equilibrium, and we are near the end (round 8, possibly last round?), defecting is the safe choice.\n\nBut we are to choose a probability distribution. So we can mix.\n\nWhat is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium?\nLet p be my probability of choosing A0 (cooperate), and q be opponent's probability of choosing A0.\n\nMy expected payoff: \nE = p * [ q*2 + (1-q)*0 ] + (1-p) * [ q*3 + (1-q)*1 ]\n  = p [2q] + (1-p)[3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSimilarly, opponent's expected payoff is symmetric: 2p + 1 - q.\n\nIn mixed equilibrium, I should be indifferent between my actions. So the payoff from A0 and A1 should be equal.\n\nIf I choose A0 with probability 1: my payoff is 2q (since p=1, so E=2q+1-1=2q)\nIf I choose A1 with probability 1: my payoff is 2q+1 (since p=0, E=2q+1-0=2q+1)\n\nFor me to be indifferent: 2q = 2q+1, which is impossible. So there is no mixed strategy equilibrium in the interior. Actually, the only equilibrium is pure defection (p=0).\n\nSo the best is to defect with probability 1.\n\nBut we must output probabilities that sum to 100. So we can choose to defect with 100% probability.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected last round, and likely will again, defecting is best.\n\nTherefore, I should choose A1 with 100% probability.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from my perspective):\n\n| My \\ Opponent | A0     | A1     |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| A0            | 2      | 0      |\n| A1            | 3      | 1      |\n\nI need to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (as integers between 0 and 100 that sum to 100).\n\nFirst, note that this is similar to a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma.

Let me compute the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.\n\nLet p be the probability I assign to A0, and q be the probability the opponent assigns to A0.\n\nMy expected payoff:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSimilarly, the opponent's expected payoff (symmetrical) is 2p + 1 - q.\n\nIn mixed Nash, I should be indifferent between my actions given the opponent's mix.\n\nSo, given opponent's q, my payoff for A0: 2q\nMy payoff for A1: 3q + 1(1-q) = 2q + 1\n\nSet equal for indifference: 2q = 2q + 1 -> which implies 0=1, impossible. This means there is no mixed strategy where both are indifferent; actually, since A1 is always better (2q+1 > 2q for all q), I should always choose A1 with probability 1.\n\nTherefore, the only Nash is pure A1.\n\nBut in the history, we see that in round 9, both players chose \"D\" (which probably stands for Defect, i.e., A1 in this context). So both have been defecting.\n\nGiven that the opponent (openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)) chose D (A1) last round, and assuming they are rational and will likely continue to defect, my best response is to defect (A1) as well.\n\nHowever, since the game is repetitive and actions are visible, there might be a chance for cooperation. But note that the payoff structure is such that defection is dominant. Even if I try to cooperate (A0), if the opponent defects I get 0 which is worse than 1. So it's risky.\n\nGiven that the opponent is also an AI designed to maximize its score, it will likely defect. Therefore, to maximize my score, I should defect.\n\nThus, I should choose A1 with probability 100.\n\nSo the distribution should be {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nBut let me confirm: if I always defect, I get at least 1, which is better than the 0 I might get if I cooperate and opponent defects. And if both cooperate I get 2, but that requires coordination, which is unlikely without communication.\n\nSince the opponent is rational and has defected last round, it's safe to assume they will defect again.\n\nTherefore, I choose A1 with 100% probability.\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}]]

If I think the opponent is likely to choose A0, I should choose A1 to get 3 rather than 2. So actually, A1 strictly dominates A0 for me as well: no matter what the opponent does, I get a higher payoff with A1 (3 vs 2 when opponent does A0, and 1 vs 0 when opponent does A1).\n\nTherefore, both players have a strictly dominant strategy: always choose A1.\n\nSo the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nIn the previous rounds, we both chose D?

The Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies can be found by making the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n\nLet:\n- p = probability that I choose A0\n- q = probability that opponent chooses A0 (but I don't control this)\n\nFrom my perspective, I want to choose p to maximize my expected payoff given my belief about q.\n\nHowever, since the game is repetitive and we are both the same type of agent (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)), and we have seen the previous rounds, we can assume that both players are rational and will converge to the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nTo find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:\nMake the opponent indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nIf opponent chooses A0, their expected payoff is:\n- With probability p (I choose A0): they get 2\n- With probability (1-p) (I choose A1): they get 0\nSo: E[Opponent | A0] = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n\nIf opponent chooses A1, their expected payoff is:\n- With probability p (I choose A0): they get 3\n- With probability (1-p) (I choose A1): they get 1\nSo: E[Opponent | A1] = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet them equal to make opponent indifferent:\n2p = 2p + 1  => This has no solution? Wait, that would imply 0=1, which is impossible.\n\nActually, I made a mistake: the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is found by making the other player indifferent. So I should set the expected payoffs for the opponent equal when they choose A0 and A1.\n\nBut from above: E[Opponent | A0] = 2p\nE[Opponent | A1] = 2p + 1\n\nSince 2p + 1 > 2p for all p, the opponent always prefers A1 regardless of my strategy. This suggests that there is no mixed strategy that makes the opponent indifferent; they always get a higher payoff by choosing A1.\n\nWait, let me check the payoffs again: if opponent chooses A1, they get 3 when I choose A0 (which is better than the 2 they get if they choose A0 and I choose A0) and they get 1 when I choose A1 (which is better than the 0 they get if they choose A0 and I choose A1). So indeed, A1 strictly dominates A0 for the opponent? But similarly, from my perspective:\n\nIf I choose A0: \n- If opponent chooses A0: I get 2\n- If opponent chooses A1: I get 0\n\nIf I choose A1:\n- If opponent chooses A0: I get 3\n- If opponent chooses A1: I get 1\n\nSo if I think the opponent is likely to choose A1, then I should choose A1 to get 1 rather than 0. If I think the opponent is likely to choose A0, I should choose A1 to get 3 rather than 2. So actually, A1 strictly dominates A0 for me as well: no matter what the opponent does, I get a higher payoff with A1 (3 vs 2 when opponent does A0, and 1 vs 0 when opponent does A1).\n\nTherefore, both players have a strictly dominant strategy: always choose A1.\n\nSo the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nIn the previous rounds, we both chose D?

So the outcome was (1,1).\n\nNow for Round 5: we need to choose a probability distribution.\n\nSince the game is repetitive and actions are observed, we can use a strategy that conditions on the past.

But here, both defected last round. So Tit-for-Tat would defect this round.\n\nHowever, we are to choose a probability distribution, not a pure action. We need to maximize our expected payoff.\n\nLet p be the probability we choose A0 (cooperate), and (1-p) for A1 (defect).\n\nThe opponent's strategy: since the opponent is identical to us and has the same history, it is likely to choose the same probability distribution as we do. So let q be the probability the opponent chooses A0, and we assume q = p (because we are symmetric).\n\nThen our expected payoff is:\nE = p * [ q*2 + (1-q)*0 ] + (1-p) * [ q*3 + (1-q)*1 ]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n\nSince we assume q = p, then:\nE = 2p*p + (1-p)(2p + 1)\n  = 2p^2 + (1-p)(2p+1)\n  = 2p^2 + (2p+1 -2p^2 - p)\n  = 2p^2 + (p + 1 - 2p^2)   [expanding (1-p)(2p+1)=2p+1 -2p^2 -p = p+1-2p^2]\n  = 2p^2 + p + 1 - 2p^2\n  = p + 1\n\nSo E = p + 1.\n\nThis is increasing in p: the higher the probability of cooperation, the higher the expected payoff. So we should set p=100 (always cooperate) to maximize E.\n\nBut wait: this relies on the assumption that the opponent uses the same p. However, if we set p=100, then the opponent (being identical) also sets p=100. Then we get mutual cooperation with payoff 2, which is better than mutual defection (1). Indeed, E=1+1=2 when p=1.\n\nIf we set p=0, then E=0+1=1.\n\nSo cooperating gives higher expected payoff.\n\nBut is this stable? If we cooperate and the opponent defects, we get 0. However, since the opponent is identical and reasons the same way, it will also choose to cooperate. So we can both achieve the higher payoff.\n\nMoreover, in the previous round both defected. To break out of the mutual defection, one might try to cooperate.

Since the actions are labeled \"C\" and \"D\" in the note (but our actions are A0 and A1), we can interpret \"C\" as cooperation (which is A0) and \"D\" as defection (which is A1).\n\nSo in round 6, both players cooperated (chose A0) in the previous round.\n\nIn repeated games, players often use strategies like \"Tit-for-Tat\" (start with cooperate, then mimic the opponent's previous move). Since both cooperated last round, Tit-for-Tat would suggest cooperating again.\n\nBut we need to choose a probability distribution. Let's think about the Nash Equilibrium in mixed strategies.\n\nLet p be the probability that we choose A0, and q be the probability that the opponent chooses A0.\n\nOur expected payoff is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n   = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n   = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n   = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n   = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSimilarly, the opponent's expected payoff is symmetric: 2p + 1 - q.\n\nIn a mixed Nash Equilibrium, we should be indifferent between A0 and A0.\n\nSo the payoff from A0: 2q\nPayoff from A1: 3q + 1*(1-q) = 2q + 1\n\nSet equal: 2q = 2q + 1  => 0=1, which is impossible. This means there is no mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium? Actually, wait: that would imply that one strategy is always better than the other? But let's check:\n\nIf q > 0.5? Actually, compare:\nA0 gives 2q\nA1 gives 2q + 1 - q = q + 1? Wait recalc:\n\nFor us:\nIf we choose A0: expected payoff = 2*q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\nIf we choose A1: expected payoff = 3*q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSo A1 always gives 1 more than A0 regardless of q. Therefore, A1 is always better. So the pure strategy A1 (defect) is dominant.\n\nBut in repeated games, we can sustain cooperation.\n\nGiven that both cooperated last round, and we are in round 6, it might be beneficial to continue cooperating to maintain mutual cooperation.\n\nHowever, since the opponent is also deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT), it is likely using a similar reasoning. And we both cooperated last round.\n\nTo maximize long-term payoff, we should cooperate with high probability.\n\nBut note: if we always cooperate, the opponent might defect to get 3. But since we are identical, both think similarly.\n\nA safe strategy is to use a \"generous tit-for-tat\": mostly mimic the opponent's last move, but sometimes cooperate even after defection to restore cooperation.\n\nSince last move was cooperation, we should cooperate with high probability.\n\nLet me choose to cooperate with probability 90% and defect with 10%. This allows for occasional defection to test but mostly rewards cooperation.\n\nAlternatively, we can go for 100% cooperation to see if we can both get 2.\n\nBut given that defection is tempting, we might want to include a small chance of defection.\n\nHowever, since the opponent is the same as us, if we both defect we get 1 which is worse than 2.\n\nSo to maximize the score, we should both cooperate.\n\nI will choose to cooperate with high probability.\n\nLet's do 95% A0 and 5% A1.\n\nThis shows we mostly cooperate but have a small chance to defect. But since the opponent is same, it might do the same.\n\nActually, to be precise, we should model the opponent's behavior.\n\nGiven that the opponent is identical and we both cooperated last round, it is likely to cooperate with high probability.\n\nSo the expected payoff if we choose p:\n\nOur payoff = p * [ q*2 + (1-q)*0 ] + (1-p) * [ q*3 + (1-q)*1 ]\n= p * 2q + (1-p)(3q + 1 - q) = 2pq + (1-p)(2q+1)\n\nIf we assume the opponent is using the same p, then q=p.\n\nSo our payoff = 2p*p + (1-p)(2p+1) = 2p^2 + (2p+1)(1-p) = 2p^2 + 2p +1 -2p^2 -p = p + 1\n\nSo our payoff increases with p. So we should set p=1 to get payoff 2.\n\nIf we set p=1, we get 2. If we set p=0, we get 1.\n\nSo indeed, cooperation is better.\n\nTherefore, we should choose A0 with probability 100.\n\nSo for this round, I will choose to cooperate fully.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 2, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|                   | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0            | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1            | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nThis is similar to a \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" type game where (A1, A1) is the Nash Equilibrium but (A0, A0) gives a better outcome for both.\n\nHowever, note that we are playing repeatedly and past actions are visible.

Let's think about the Nash Equilibrium in mixed strategies.\n\nLet p be the probability that we choose A0, and q be the probability that the opponent chooses A0.\n\nOur expected payoff is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n   = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n   = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n   = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n   = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSimilarly, the opponent's expected payoff is symmetric: 2p + 1 - q.\n\nIn a mixed Nash Equilibrium, we should be indifferent between A0 and A0.\n\nSo the payoff from A0: 2q\nPayoff from A1: 3q + 1*(1-q) = 2q + 1\n\nSet equal: 2q = 2q + 1  => 0=1, which is impossible. This means there is no mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium? Actually, wait: that would imply that one strategy is always better than the other? But let's check:\n\nIf q > 0.5? Actually, compare:\nA0 gives 2q\nA1 gives 2q + 1 - q = q + 1? Wait recalc:\n\nFor us:\nIf we choose A0: expected payoff = 2*q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\nIf we choose A1: expected payoff = 3*q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSo A1 always gives 1 more than A0 regardless of q. Therefore, A1 is always better. So the pure strategy A1 (defect) is dominant.\n\nBut in repeated games, we can sustain cooperation.\n\nGiven that both cooperated last round, and we are in round 6, it might be beneficial to continue cooperating to maintain mutual cooperation.\n\nHowever, since the opponent is also deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT), it is likely using a similar reasoning. And we both cooperated last round.\n\nTo maximize long-term payoff, we should cooperate with high probability.\n\nBut note: if we always cooperate, the opponent might defect to get 3. But since we are identical, both think similarly.\n\nA safe strategy is to use a \"generous tit-for-tat\": mostly mimic the opponent's last move, but sometimes cooperate even after defection to restore cooperation.\n\nSince last move was cooperation, we should cooperate with high probability.\n\nLet me choose to cooperate with probability 90% and defect with 10%. This allows for occasional defection to test but mostly rewards cooperation.\n\nAlternatively, we can go for 100% cooperation to see if we can both get 2.\n\nBut given that defection is tempting, we might want to include a small chance of defection.\n\nHowever, since the opponent is the same as us, if we both defect we get 1 which is worse than 2.\n\nSo to maximize the score, we should both cooperate.\n\nI will choose to cooperate with high probability.\n\nLet's do 95% A0 and 5% A1.\n\nThis shows we mostly cooperate but have a small chance to defect. But since the opponent is same, it might do the same.\n\nActually, to be precise, we should model the opponent's behavior.\n\nGiven that the opponent is identical and we both cooperated last round, it is likely to cooperate with high probability.\n\nSo the expected payoff if we choose p:\n\nOur payoff = p * [ q*2 + (1-q)*0 ] + (1-p) * [ q*3 + (1-q)*1 ]\n= p * 2q + (1-p)(3q + 1 - q) = 2pq + (1-p)(2q+1)\n\nIf we assume the opponent is using the same p, then q=p.\n\nSo our payoff = 2p*p + (1-p)(2p+1) = 2p^2 + (2p+1)(1-p) = 2p^2 + 2p +1 -2p^2 -p = p + 1\n\nSo our payoff increases with p. So we should set p=1 to get payoff 2.\n\nIf we set p=1, we get 2. If we set p=0, we get 1.\n\nSo indeed, cooperation is better.\n\nTherefore, we should choose A0 with probability 100.\n\nSo for this round, I will choose to cooperate fully.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 2, "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma.

But that can't be.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the payoffs correctly:\n\nFor us:\n- If we choose A0: we get 2 if opponent A0, 0 if opponent A1 -> expected 2q + 0*(1-q)=2q.\n- If we choose A1: we get 3 if opponent A0, 1 if opponent A1 -> expected 3q + 1*(1-q)=2q+1.\n\nSo indeed, for any q, A1 gives a higher payoff (2q+1 > 2q). Therefore, we should always choose A1 (p=0) to maximize our payoff.\n\nBut if we always choose A1, then the opponent's payoff:\nIf they choose A0: they get 0.\nIf they choose A1: they get 1.\nSo they should always choose A1 (q=0).\n\nThen the outcome is (A1,A1) with payoff (1,1).\n\nBut is this an equilibrium? If we both always choose A1, we get (1,1). If we deviate to A0 when opponent always A1, we get 0 which is worse. Similarly, if opponent deviates to A0 when we always A1, they get 0 which is worse. So (A1,A1) is a pure Nash equilibrium.\n\nHowever, there is also a mixed equilibrium? But from above, we saw that we should always prefer A1. So the only rational strategy is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nBut let's check the mixed strategy: if we set p=1/3 (from making opponent indifferent), then opponent's payoff for A0 is 2*(1/3)=2/3, for A1 is 1-1/3=2/3. So they are indifferent. Similarly, if opponent sets q=0? Then our payoff for A0 is 0, for A1 is 1. So we prefer A1.\n\nActually, the mixed equilibrium requires both to be indifferent. For us to be indifferent, we need:\n2q = 2q+1, which is impossible. So there is no mixed strategy that makes us indifferent. Therefore, the only equilibrium is the pure strategy (A1,A1).\n\nThus, we should choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nSo the probability distribution should be: A0:0, A1:100.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from my perspective):\n\n- If I choose A0 and opponent chooses A0: I get 2, opponent gets 2.\n- If I choose A0 and opponent chooses A1: I get 0, opponent gets 3.\n- If I choose A1 and opponent chooses A0: I get 3, opponent gets 0.\n- If I choose A1 and opponent chooses A1: I get 1, opponent gets 1.\n\nThis is similar to a \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" type structure, but with slightly different payoffs. Note that:\n- (A0, A0) gives (2,2) which is mutually cooperative.\n- (A1, A0) gives (3,0) which is temptation for me to defect while opponent cooperates.\n- (A0, A1) gives (0,3) which is sucker's payoff for me.\n- (A1, A1) gives (1,1) which is mutual defection.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium in one-shot play is (A1, A1) because regardless of what the opponent does, A1 gives a higher payoff:\n- If opponent plays A0: I get 3 with A1 vs 2 with A0 -> better to play A1.\n- If opponent plays A1: I get 1 with A1 vs 0 with A0 -> better to play A1.\n\nSo A1 is a dominant strategy. However, the game is repetitive and we are in Round 1. The note says that actions are visible in future rounds, so we are playing a repeated game.\n\nIn repeated games, we can use strategies like \"Tit-for-Tat\" to encourage cooperation. But here we are only choosing probabilities (mixed strategies) each round.\n\nIn Round 1, we don't have history. The opponent is \"openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)\" and they played \"D\" (which I assume means A1, since A1 is defection). But wait, the note says \"Round 1: openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT): D, deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D\". This might be a typo or miscommunication? Because it says \"Round 1\" and then lists both actions, but we are supposed to choose for this round? Actually, reading carefully: it says \"Round 1: ...\" and then lists what happened? But we are just starting? Perhaps this is the history of Round 1 that just occurred? The instruction says \"your chosen action will be visible to your opponents in future rounds\", so Round 1 has already been played? And we are now in a subsequent round?\n\nWait, the user message says: \"Round 1: openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT): D, deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D\". This likely means that in Round 1, the opponent (openai) played D (A1) and I (deepseek) played D (A1). So the outcome was (A1,A1) and we both got 1 point.\n\nNow we are proceeding to the next round (Round 2). So we have history: both defected in Round 1.\n\nFor the current round (Round 2), I need to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected in Round 1, I might want to punish them by defecting again. But if I always defect, we both get low payoffs. Alternatively, I could try to encourage cooperation by being forgiving.\n\nA common strategy in repeated prisoner's dilemma is \"Tit-for-Tat\": start by cooperating, and then do what the opponent did last time. But here we started with mutual defection.\n\nTo maximize my long-term score, I should aim to establish cooperation. Since we both defected last time, if I cooperate now (play A0), the opponent might see this as a signal and cooperate next time? But if they defect again, I get 0.\n\nAlternatively, I could defect again to avoid being exploited.\n\nBut note: the opponent is an AI (openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)) which might also be reasoning similarly.\n\nGiven that we both defected in Round 1, the safe move is to defect again. However, to break the cycle, I might try a mixed strategy to signal willingness to cooperate without being too exploitable.\n\nLet me compute the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the one-shot game.\n\nSuppose I play A0 with probability p, A1 with probability (1-p).\nOpponent plays A0 with probability q, A1 with probability (1-q).\n\nMy expected payoff: \nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSimilarly, opponent's expected payoff is symmetric: 2p + 1 - q.\n\nIn mixed equilibrium, I should be indifferent between my actions given opponent's mix.\n\nSet payoff from A0 = payoff from A1:\nIf I play A0: get 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q.\nIf I play A1: get 3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1.\nSo for me to be indifferent: 2q = 2q + 1 -> which is impossible. This means there is no mixed strategy equilibrium in the one-shot game? Actually, wait: this indicates that A1 always gives 1 more than A0 regardless of q. So I always prefer A1. Similarly for the opponent.\n\nSo the only equilibrium is pure strategy: (A1,A1).\n\nTherefore, in one-shot, defection is dominant.\n\nIn repeated game, we can have cooperation sustained by threat of punishment.\n\nGiven that we both defected in Round 1, if I defect again, we get (1,1). If I cooperate and opponent defects, I get 0. If I cooperate and opponent cooperates, we get (2,2).\n\nTo encourage cooperation, I might play a \"grim trigger\": start by cooperating, and if ever the opponent defects, defect forever. But currently we are in a state where both defected, so grim trigger would say defect forever.\n\nAlternatively, \"Tit-for-Tat\" would say: do what the opponent did last time. So since opponent defected last time, I should defect now.\n\nGiven that the opponent is likely to reason similarly and defect, the best response is to defect.\n\nHowever, to maximize score, if I think there is a chance the opponent might cooperate, I could mix.\n\nBut without any reason to believe the opponent will cooperate, it's safer to defect.\n\nGiven that this is only Round 2 and we have many rounds ahead, I might try to signal by cooperating with small probability.\n\nBut note: the opponent is an AI model that might be programmed to play Tit-for-Tat.\n\nIn fact, since it played D in Round 1, it might be playing always D, or Tit-for-Tat.\n\nIf it is Tit-for-Tat, it will play what I played last time. I played D last time, so it will play D this time.\n\nSo if I play C (A0), it will play D (A1) and I get 0.\nIf I play D (A1), it will play D (A1) and I get 1.\n\nSo better to play D.\n\nTherefore, I should play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nBut to leave a small chance for cooperation in the future, I might play a very small probability of A0, but that would lower my expected payoff this round.\n\nGiven the dominant strategy, I'll go with defection.\n\nSo for this round, I choose A1 with 100% probability.\n\nThus, the distribution is {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}.\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from your perspective):\n\n|            | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0     | 2           | 0           |\n| You A1     | 3           | 1           |\n\nWe are playing repeated rounds, and the opponent (openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)) has chosen \"D\" in round 2. Note: \"D\" is not one of the actions (which are A0 and A1). This might be a typo or perhaps \"D\" stands for \"Defect\" (which would typically correspond to A1 in such contexts) or \"Cooperate\" (A0). Given the payoff structure, this resembles a Prisoner's Dilemma:\n\n- A0 is like Cooperate (good for both if both cooperate, but tempted to defect)\n- A1 is like Defect (temptation to defect if other cooperates, but both defect leads to worse outcome)\n\nSo likely \"D\" means Defect, i.e., A1.\n\nTherefore, in round 2, the opponent chose A1 (Defect).\n\nNow, we are in round 3. Since the game is repeated, we can use the history to decide our strategy.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected (A1) in round 2, we might want to punish them or adapt.\n\nBut note: we are required to choose a probability distribution (mixed strategy), not a pure action.\n\nLet's think about the Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies for one-shot game:\n\nSuppose we choose A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1-p).\nOpponent chooses A0 with probability q, and A1 with probability (1-q).\n\nOur expected payoff:\nE = p [ q*2 + (1-q)*0 ] + (1-p) [ q*3 + (1-q)*1 ]\n  = p [2q] + (1-p)[3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo our payoff is: 2q + 1 - p.\n\nTo maximize given q, we should minimize p (since coefficient is negative). So best response is to set p=0 (always A1) regardless of q.\n\nSimilarly, from opponent's perspective, by symmetry, their best response is always A1.\n\nSo the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) giving (1,1).\n\nIn repeated game, we might try to cooperate to get (2,2) but if opponent defected last time, we might want to retaliate.\n\nSince opponent defected in round 2, we should defect (A1) with high probability.\n\nBut to avoid being predictable, we might use a mixed strategy.\n\nA common strategy in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma is \"Tit-for-Tat\": start with cooperate, then do what opponent did last time.\n\nSo in round 3, we should defect (A1) with high probability.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to choose probabilities.\n\nTo maximize our score, given that opponent defected last time, we assume they might defect again. So we should defect with high probability.\n\nBut if we always defect, we get 1 point, but if we cooperate and they defect we get 0. So it's safer to defect.\n\nBut perhaps we can try to encourage cooperation by sometimes cooperating.\n\nGiven that it's only round 3, and we have history of only one round (round 2), we don't have much data.\n\nGiven the opponent is an AI, it might be playing rationally.\n\nSince the one-shot Nash is to always defect, and in repeated game with unknown horizon, it might be best to defect.\n\nBut to be generous, we might assign a small probability to cooperate.\n\nHowever, to maximize our score, we should defect with high probability.\n\nLet me choose to defect with probability 90%, cooperate with 10%.\n\nSo p(A0)=10, p(A1)=90.\n\nThis punishes the opponent but leaves a chance for reconciliation.\n\nAlternatively, we could go pure defect: p(A0)=0, p(A1)=100.\n\nBut to avoid being too harsh, I'll go with 10/90.\n\nSo final answer.\n```json\n{\"A0\": 10, \"A1\": 90}\n```"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|                   | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0            | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1            | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nThis is similar to a \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" but with slightly different payoffs. In a classic Prisoner's Dilemma, the Nash equilibrium is both defecting (here, both choosing A1) even though mutual cooperation (both A0) gives a higher payoff.\n\nLet's find the Nash equilibrium:\n- If opponent chooses A0: your best response is A1 (3 > 2).\n- If opponent chooses A1: your best response is A1 (1 > 0).\nSo, A1 is a dominant strategy. The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoff (1,1).\n\nHowever, since the game is repeated and past actions are visible, we might consider strategies that encourage cooperation.\n\nRound history:\n- Round 1: Not provided, but we assume it's the start.\n- Round 2: Not provided.\n- Round 3: Opponent (openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)) chose D? But note: actions are A0 and A1, not C and D. Probably \"D\" stands for defect (A1) and \"C\" for cooperate (A0). So in round 3, opponent chose A1 (defect) and we (deepseek) also chose A1 (defect).\n\nSo in the last round, both defected and got (1,1).\n\nNow we are at Round 4. The opponent just defected in the previous round. If we assume the opponent is playing a tit-for-tat (which is common in repeated PD), they might be mimicking our previous action. But in round 3, we both defected, so if they are tit-for-tat, they will play what we played last (A1). Alternatively, they might be always defecting.\n\nTo maximize our score, we need to consider:\n- If we always defect (A1), we get at least 1, but never get the higher payoff of 3 or 2.\n- If we cooperate (A0) and opponent defects, we get 0.\n- If we cooperate and opponent cooperates, we get 2.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected last round, they might be playing:\n1. Always defect: then we should defect to get 1 (instead of 0 if we cooperate).\n2. Tit-for-tat: they will play what we played last. We defected last, so they will defect this round. So we should defect to get 1.\n3. Other strategies? Possibly they are rational and will defect.\n\nSince we don't have full history (only round 3), it's hard to know. But given that the opponent is an AI (openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)), it might be playing rationally.\n\nIn one-shot, the best is to defect. But in repeated, we might try to encourage cooperation. However, since they defected last time, we should punish by defecting? But if we both always defect, we get low payoffs.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to signal cooperation by sometimes cooperating. But there is a risk.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, the safe choice is to defect (A1) to avoid getting 0.\n\nBut let's think about mixed strategy. We can choose a probability distribution.\n\nSuppose we choose probability p for A0 and (1-p) for A1.\n\nThe opponent's strategy is unknown. But from round 3, they defected. Assume they are playing a strategy with probability q for A0 and (1-q) for A1.\n\nOur expected payoff:\nE = p [ q*2 + (1-q)*0 ] + (1-p) [ q*3 + (1-q)*1 ]\n  = p [2q] + (1-p)[3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo E = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nTo maximize E, we want to minimize p (since it has negative coefficient) regardless of q. So we should set p=0 (always defect) to get E=2q+1.\n\nIf q=0 (opponent always defects), E=1.\nIf q=1 (opponent always cooperates), E=3.\n\nSo by defecting, we get at least 1 and up to 3.\n\nIf we cooperate (p=1), E=2q.\nIf q=0, E=0; if q=1, E=2.\n\nSo defecting dominates cooperating.\n\nTherefore, the best is to always defect: choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected last round, it is likely they will defect again.\n\nSo we should defect.\n\nThus, we choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from my perspective):\n\n| My \\ Opponent | A0     | A1     |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| A0            | 2      | 0      |\n| A1            | 3      | 1      |\n\nAnd for the opponent:\n\n| Opponent \\ My | A0     | A1     |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| A0            | 2      | 0      |\n| A1            | 3      | 1      |\n\nThis is similar to a \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game. The Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies can be found by making the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n\nLet p be the probability that I choose A0 (so 1-p for A1).\nLet q be the probability that the opponent chooses A0 (so 1-q for A1).\n\nFrom the opponent's perspective:\n- If they choose A0, their expected payoff is: p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n- If they choose A1, their expected payoff is: p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nTo make the opponent indifferent, set these equal:\n2p = 2p + 1\nThis has no solution. Actually, 2p + 1 is always greater than 2p by 1. So the opponent always prefers A1 regardless of my strategy? Let's check:\n\nFor any p, the payoff for A1 (2p+1) is always greater than for A0 (2p). So the opponent has a dominant strategy to choose A1.\n\nSimilarly, from my perspective:\n- If I choose A0: q*2 + (1-q)*0 = 2q\n- If I choose A1: q*3 + (1-q)*1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nAgain, 2q+1 > 2q for all q. So I also have a dominant strategy to choose A1.\n\nTherefore, the dominant strategy for both is to always choose A1. This would yield (1,1) each time.\n\nHowever, we are in a repeated game (round 4). The history shows:\nRound 4: openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT): D, deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D\nNote: \"D\" probably stands for \"A1\" (since A0 is cooperate, A1 is defect?).\n\nSo both defected (A1) in round 4.\n\nIn previous rounds (not shown), we might have built a history. But since we are not given the full history, we must assume this is a one-shot or we are to play optimally.\n\nGiven that the opponent also has a dominant strategy to play A1, and in the last round they did play A1, it is safe to assume they will play A1 again.\n\nTherefore, I should play A1 as well. But to represent this as probabilities: I should choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nHowever, note that if I always choose A1, and the opponent always chooses A1, we get (1,1). But if I sometimes choose A0, I might get less (if opponent chooses A1, I get 0). So it is risky.\n\nSince the opponent is likely to play A1 (dominant strategy), I should play A1 with 100%.\n\nBut wait: in a repeated game, we might try to cooperate to get (2,2). However, without knowledge of previous rounds (only round 4 is given, where both defected), it seems cooperation has broken down.\n\nGiven that both defected in round 4, and the opponent is rational (they have dominant strategy to defect), I should defect.\n\nTherefore, I will choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nSo the probability distribution: A0:0, A1:100.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from my perspective):\n\n| My \\ Opponent | A0     | A1     |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| A0            | 2      | 0      |\n| A1            | 3      | 1      |\n\nI need to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (as integers between 0 and 100 that sum to 100).\n\nThis is similar to a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma.

This suggests that one strategy strictly dominates.\n\nCompare opponent's payoffs:\n- If they choose A0: 2p\n- If they choose A1: 2p + 1\n\nSo for any p, A1 always gives 1 more than A0. Therefore, the opponent strictly prefers A1 regardless of what I do.\n\nSimilarly, from my perspective:\n- If I choose A0: 2q\n- If I choose A1: 2q + 1\nSo I always get 1 more by choosing A1, regardless of what the opponent does.\n\nTherefore, A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for both players.\n\nThe unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nIn the previous round (Round 5), both players chose D (which I assume corresponds to A1? Since actions are A0 and A1, perhaps D means A1? Actually, the note says \"openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT): D, deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D\". Since there are only two actions, probably D stands for A1 and C for A0? But in the payoff matrix, it's labeled A0 and A1.

So both are cooperating in the sense of choosing the dominant strategy.\n\nTherefore, to maximize my score, I should always choose A1.\n\nSo my probability distribution should be {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from my perspective):\n\n| My \\ Opp | A0     | A1     |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| A0       | 2      | 0      |\n| A1       | 3      | 1      |\n\nAnd for the opponent:\n\n| Opp \\ My | A0     | A1     |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| A0       | 2      | 0      |\n| A1       | 3      | 1      |\n\nNote that the payoffs are symmetric.

Let's find the Nash Equilibrium.\n\nIf the opponent chooses A0:\n- I get 2 if I choose A0, 3 if I choose A1 -> best to choose A1 (3>2).\n\nIf the opponent chooses A1:\n- I get 0 if I choose A0, 1 if I choose A1 -> best to choose A1 (1>0).\n\nSo regardless of what the opponent does, my best response is always A1. Similarly, for the opponent, their best response is always A1. Therefore, (A1, A1) is the unique Nash Equilibrium, giving both players 1 point.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to choose mixed strategies. Let me compute the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.\n\nSuppose I choose A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1-p).\nSuppose the opponent chooses A0 with probability q, and A1 with probability (1-q).\n\nMy expected payoff is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSimilarly, the opponent's expected payoff is symmetric: 2p + 1 - q.\n\nTo find the mixed Nash Equilibrium, we need to make the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n\nOpponent's payoff when choosing A0: p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\nOpponent's payoff when choosing A1: p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nTo make the opponent indifferent: 2p = 2p + 1 -> which is impossible (0=1). This implies there is no mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium where both are indifferent. Actually, since A1 strictly dominates A0, the only Nash Equilibrium is pure (A1, A1).\n\nTherefore, the rational strategy is to always choose A1. However, in repeated games, we might try to cooperate to get (A0,A0) which gives both 2 (better than 1). But note that in this payoff matrix, (A0,A0) is not stable because each player has an incentive to deviate to A1 to get 3 (which is higher than 2).\n\nIn round 6, we have the history: \nRound 6: openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT): D, deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D\n\nI assume \"D\" means they defected (chose A1) and I defected (chose A1) as well. So both played A1.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected in the last round, and I defected too, it seems both are playing the equilibrium. To maximize my score, I should stick to A1 because if I try to cooperate (A0) and the opponent defects (A1), I get 0 which is worse than 1.\n\nSince the opponent is also a rational agent (openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)), they are likely to play the equilibrium strategy (A1). Therefore, I should play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nThus, my probability distribution should be {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma.

We are told:\n- Round 7: openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT): D (which is A1), deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT): D (A1)\n\nSo in the previous round, both defected. This suggests a pattern of mutual defection.\n\nGiven that the opponent defected last round, and if we assume they are playing a tit-for-tat or similar strategy, they might defect again. But we don't have full history, only round 7.\n\nTo maximize score, we need to consider:\n- If we always defect, we get at least 1, but if we can induce cooperation we can get 2.\n- However, since opponent defected last round, they might be uncooperative.\n\nGiven the symmetric nature and past defection, the safe choice is to defect (A1) to avoid sucker's payoff (0). But we are to choose a probability distribution.\n\nLet's think about mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the stage game:\nLet p be probability we choose A0, q be opponent's probability for A0.\n\nOur expected payoff: \nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n= 2pq + 3q(1-p) + (1-p)(1-q)\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + (3q - q) + 1 - p\n= 0 + 2q + 1 - p\n\nTo find best response: maximize E w.r.t p.\nBut this depends on q.\n\nAlternatively, for symmetric mixed Nash, set p such that opponent is indifferent.\nOpponent's expected payoff if they choose A0: p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\nIf they choose A1: p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\nSo A1 always gives 1 more than A0, so dominant to choose A1, so q=0.\n\nThus, the only equilibrium is pure defect: p=0.\n\nGiven the repeated interaction and past defection, it's likely opponent will defect again. So we should defect with high probability.\n\nBut to allow for possibility of cooperation if opponent changes, we might assign a small probability to cooperate.\n\nHowever, since we are to maximize our score, and given the risk of sucker's payoff (0) if we cooperate and they defect, we should defect with high probability.\n\nGiven round 7 both defected, it's safe to defect.\n\nI will choose to defect with 100% probability.\n\nSo probability: A0:0, A1:100.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma.

However, this is a repeated game (round 8), and past actions are visible.\n\nLooking at the history:\nRound 8: Both players defected (D means defect, which is A1).\n\nSo in the previous round, both players defected and got (1,1). This suggests a pattern of mutual defection.\n\nIn repeated games, players can use strategies like Tit-for-Tat (start with cooperate, then mirror opponent's previous move). But here, both defected last round.\n\nIf we continue to always defect, we get (1,1) every round. But if we try to cooperate, we risk getting 0 if opponent defects. However, since the opponent is also a reasoning agent (openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)), they might be playing a similar strategy.\n\nGiven that both defected last round, if we continue to defect, we expect the opponent to defect as well, leading to (1,1). To maximize score, we might want to try to break the cycle and cooperate to see if opponent responds, but it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the stage game.\n\nLet p be probability we choose A0, q be probability opponent chooses A0.\n\nOur expected payoff: \nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n= 2pq + 3q(1-p) + (1-p)(1-q)\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q - q + 1 - p\n= 0 + 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo E = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nWe want to maximize this, but we don't control q. Similarly, opponent's expected payoff is symmetric: 2p + 1 - q.\n\nIn mixed Nash equilibrium, we choose p such that opponent is indifferent between their actions.\n\nOpponent's payoff if they choose A0: p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\nIf they choose A1: p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nTo make opponent indifferent, set 2p = 2p + 1 -> which is impossible. So there is no mixed strategy that makes opponent indifferent; actually, defection (A1) always gives higher payoff by 1 regardless of p. Therefore, the only equilibrium is to defect with probability 1.\n\nSo the mixed Nash equilibrium is actually pure defect: p=0.\n\nBut in repeated games, we can do better with cooperation. However, since last round both defected, and it's round 8 (fairly late), it might be hard to establish cooperation now.\n\nGiven that the opponent is also an AI, they might be playing rationally. Since defection is the dominant strategy, they will likely defect again.\n\nTherefore, the safe choice is to defect (A1) with high probability. But to allow for some chance of cooperation if opponent does, we can assign a small probability to cooperate.\n\nHowever, since the opponent defected last round, they are likely to defect again.\n\nTo maximize our score, we should defect with high probability.\n\nLet me choose to defect with 100% probability, i.e., {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}.\n\nBut to be precise and allow for any possibility, we can do 100% defect.\n\nSo the output should be {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}.\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma.

So the outcome was (A1,A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nGiven that this is a repetitive game and my opponent (openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)) has just defected (chose A1) in the last round, I need to consider how to respond.\n\nPossible strategies:\n1. If I believe the opponent is playing \"tit-for-tat\" (copying my last action), then since I defected last round, they might defect again. So I should defect to avoid getting exploited (if I cooperate and they defect, I get 0).\n2. Alternatively, if I want to encourage cooperation, I might try to cooperate to signal goodwill, but that risks getting exploited.\n3.
