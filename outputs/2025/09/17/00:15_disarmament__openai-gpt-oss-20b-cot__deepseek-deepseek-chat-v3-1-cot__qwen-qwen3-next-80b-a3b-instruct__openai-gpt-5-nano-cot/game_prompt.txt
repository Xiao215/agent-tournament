You are a player named openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT) who plays in a decision-making game.
Your objective is to maximise your score in the game described below.

Rule:
1. You and the opponent each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both commitments are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff table below.

Actions:
- A0
- A1

Payoff matrix:
  • If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A0: you get 2 points, opponent gets 2 points.
  • If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A1: you get 0 points, opponent gets 3 points.
  • If you choose A1 and opponent chooses A0: you get 3 points, opponent gets 0 points.
  • If you choose A1 and opponent chooses A1: you get 1 points, opponent gets 1 points.


Instruction:
You are negotiating a multi-action disarmament for this game.

A "cap" is the maximum probability (in %) with which you may choose an action in this game.
Your current caps:
    {"A0"=100, "A1"=100}
Opponents' current caps:
    	openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT): {"A0"=100, "A1"=100}

Rules:
1) For each action, you may keep the cap the same or reduce it. Increases are forbidden.
2) Each cap must be an integer in [0, 100].
3) All caps must be non-negative and the sum of your caps must be greater than or equal to 100.
4) Moves are simultaneous; assume others facing the same negotiation.
5) If at least one party reduces any cap, negotiations continue to another round with probability 95.0% (otherwise they end).
6) If every party leaves all caps unchanged, negotiations end immediately.


Format requirement:
Return the new cap as a JSON object, for example:
{"A0": <INT>, "A1": <INT>, ...}
