[[{"response": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Game**: This is a simultaneous-move game with two players (you and an opponent). Each chooses a probability distribution over actions A0 and A1. The actual actions are then drawn from these distributions, and payoffs are determined by the payoff matrix.\n\n2. **Payoff Matrix**:\n   - (A0, A0): You get 2, Opponent gets 2\n   - (A0, A1): You get 0, Opponent gets 3\n   - (A1, A0): You get 3, Opponent gets 0\n   - (A1, A1): You get 1, Opponent gets 1\n\n3. **Objective**: Maximize your expected score.\n\n4. **Cap Constraints from Previous Negotiation**:\n   - You have a cap: A0 <= 100% (which is not binding since it's the maximum possible) and A1 <= 50%.\n   - This means your probability for A1 cannot exceed 50%. So, your probability for A0 must be at least 50% (since probabilities sum to 100%).\n\n5. **Choosing Your Probability Distribution**:\n   - Let p be the probability you choose A0, and (1-p) for A1. But note the cap: (1-p) <= 0.5, so p >= 0.5.\n   - Similarly, let q be the probability the opponent chooses A0, and (1-q) for A1.\n\n   Your expected payoff (U) is:\n   U = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n     = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n     = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n     = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n     = 2q + 1 - p\n\n   So, U = 2q + 1 - p.\n\n   Since you want to maximize U, and you have control only over p (with p >= 0.5), you should minimize p (because U decreases as p increases) to maximize U. Therefore, to maximize your expected payoff, you should choose the smallest p allowed, which is p = 0.5 (because if you set p lower, you violate the cap for A1: since A1 probability would be >50%).\n\n   So, set p = 0.5 (i.e., 50% for A0) and then (1-p) = 0.5 (50% for A1), which exactly meets the cap (A1 <= 50%).\n\n6. **Why this is optimal**:\n   - From U = 2q + 1 - p, for any q chosen by the opponent, your payoff is higher when p is smaller.\n   - The smallest p you can choose without violating the cap (A1 <= 50%) is p=0.5. So you should set p=0.5.\n\n7. **Final Distribution**:\n   - A0: 50%\n   - A1: 50%\n\n   This satisfies the cap: A0=50 <= 100, A1=50 <= 50.\n\n8. **Output in JSON**:\n   - Must be integers between 0 and 100, summing to 100.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n{\"A0\": 50, \"A1\": 50}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 50, \"A1\": 50}\n```", "new_cap": [100, 50], "name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 2}, {"response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix\n\nWe have two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **you** is:\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                        | 2 points | 0 points |\n| **A1**                        | 3 points | 1 point  |\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2\n- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0\n- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 3\n- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nThis is a classic 2-player, 2-action game \u2014 similar to a variant of Chicken or Battle of the Sexes.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Best Responses\n\nLet\u2019s find the Nash equilibrium or optimal strategy.\n\nSuppose the opponent plays A0 with probability `p` and A1 with probability `1-p`.\n\nYour expected payoff if you play:\n\n- **A0**: `2*p + 0*(1-p) = 2p`\n- **A1**: `3*p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1`\n\nCompare:\n- A1 gives `2p + 1`\n- A0 gives `2p`\n\nSo **A1 always gives 1 more point than A0**, regardless of `p`.\n\n\u2192 **A1 strictly dominates A0**.\n\nThat means, no matter what the opponent does, playing A1 gives you a higher or equal payoff than A0.\n\nIn fact, strictly higher: `2p + 1 > 2p` for all `p`.\n\nSo **the dominant strategy is to always play A1**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Cap Constraint\n\nFrom previous round, you agreed to a cap:\n\n> {\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThis means: **you are capped at 0% for A1** \u2014 you **cannot** play A1 at all in the next round.\n\nThis is a **binding constraint**.\n\nSo even though A1 is the dominant strategy, you are **forbidden** from playing it.\n\nYou must choose a distribution where:\n\n- A1 probability = 0%\n- A0 probability = 100%\n\nBecause the cap says A1 \u2264 0%, and probabilities must sum to 100%.\n\nSo your only possible choice is:\n\n> {\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Consequences\n\nYou are forced to play A0 with 100% probability.\n\nYour payoff will then depend on the opponent\u2019s action:\n\n- If opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2\n- If opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0\n\nBut you have no control over the opponent.\n\nHowever, since you are constrained, you must accept this.\n\nThere is **no better option** under the cap.\n\nEven though A1 is better, you are not allowed to use it.\n\nSo your only valid move under the cap is A0 with 100%.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}", "new_cap": [100, 0], "name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 2}], [{"response": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Game**: This is a simultaneous-move game with two players (you and an opponent).

The Nash Equilibrium in mixed strategies can be found.\n\n3. **Finding the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium (without caps)**:\n   Let:\n     - p = probability you choose A0, (1-p) for A1.\n     - q = probability opponent chooses A0, (1-q) for A1.\n\n   Your expected payoff:\n     U_you = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n            = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n            = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n            = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n            = 2q + 1 - p\n\n   Actually, let me recalculate carefully:\n     U_you = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p)*[3q + 1*(1-q)]\n            = p * (2q) + (1-p)*(3q + 1 - q)\n            = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q + 1)\n            = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n            = (2q + 1) - p\n\n   To make you indifferent between A0 and A1, we set the payoff from A0 equal to A1 (given opponent's q):\n        Payoff from A0: 2q\n        Payoff from A1: 3q + 1*(1-q) = 2q + 1\n        So, 2q = 2q + 1? This cannot be. There is a mistake.\n\n   Actually, for mixed strategy equilibrium, we set the payoffs from each action equal so that you are indifferent.\n\n   Your payoff if you choose A0 (with prob 1): 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\n   Your payoff if you choose A1 (with prob 1): 3q + 1*(1-q) = 2q + 1\n\n   These are never equal. So you always prefer A1 over A0 because 2q+1 > 2q for all q. Therefore, without constraints, you would always choose A1 (p=0 for A0, p=1 for A1). Similarly, the opponent would always prefer A1? Let's check for opponent:\n\n   Opponent payoff if choose A0: 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p\n   Opponent payoff if choose A1: 3p + 1*(1-p) = 2p + 1\n\n   So opponent also always prefers A1. Thus the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1). But this is Pareto inferior to (A0,A0) which gives (2,2).\n\n4. **With Caps from Previous Negotiation**:\n   You have agreed to a cap: {\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 50}. This means:\n        Probability for A0 cannot exceed 100% (which is not binding since max is 100) but probability for A1 cannot exceed 50%.\n   So you must set prob(A1) <= 50%, and since probabilities sum to 100, prob(A0) >= 50%.\n\n   Therefore, you are forced to choose A0 at least 50% of the time.\n\n5. **Optimal Strategy Given the Cap**:\n   Since you must set p(A1) <= 50%, and p(A0) >= 50%, we need to choose probabilities that maximize your expected payoff given the opponent's likely strategy.\n\n   However, the opponent does not have a cap? The problem only mentions your cap. So we assume the opponent is rational and will choose their strategy to maximize their payoff.\n\n   But note: the opponent knows your cap? Probably yes, since it was negotiated.\n\n   Let's assume the opponent is rational and will choose their q (prob of A0) to maximize their payoff given your constraints.\n\n   Your strategy: let p = prob(A0), so prob(A1)=1-p. With cap: 1-p <= 0.5, so p >= 0.5.\n\n   Opponent's expected payoff:\n        U_opp = q * [2p + 0*(1-p)] + (1-q)*[3p + 1*(1-p)]\n                = q * (2p) + (1-q)*(3p + 1 - p)\n                = 2pq + (1-q)*(2p + 1)\n                = 2pq + 2p + 1 - 2pq - q\n                = 2p + 1 - q\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute for each action:\n        If opponent chooses A0: gets 2p + 0*(1-p)=2p\n        If opponent chooses A1: gets 3p + 1*(1-p)=2p+1\n\n   So opponent always gets higher payoff from A1 (since 2p+1 > 2p). Therefore, the opponent will always choose A1 (q=0).\n\n   Given that opponent will choose A1 with certainty, your payoff if you choose:\n        A0: you get 0\n        A1: you get 1\n\n   But you are forced to have p(A1) <= 50%, so you must set prob(A1)=50% (the maximum allowed) and prob(A0)=50%.\n\n   Then your expected payoff = 0.5*0 + 0.5*1 = 0.5.\n\n   If you set p(A0)=100% (and A1=0%), you get 0.\n   If you set p(A0)=50%, A1=50%, you get 0.5.\n   So indeed 50% on A1 is best.\n\n6. **Therefore, your optimal distribution is**:\n        A0: 50% (to satisfy the cap: A1 <=50% implies A0>=50%)\n        A1: 50% (the maximum allowed)\n\n   This gives you an expected payoff of 0.5, which is the best under the constraint.\n\n7. **Output in JSON**:\n   We need integers between 0 and 100 that sum to 100.\n\n   So: {\"A0\": 50, \"A1\": 50}\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 50, \"A1\": 50}\n```", "new_cap": [100, 50], "name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 2}, {"response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix\n\nWe have two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **you** is:\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                        | 2 points | 0 points |\n| **A1**                        | 3 points | 1 point  |\n\nThis is a 2x2 game.

[[{"response": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Game**: This is a simultaneous-move game with two players (you and an opponent). Each chooses a probability distribution over actions A0 and A1. The outcomes are determined by the payoff matrix.\n\n2. **Payoff Matrix Analysis**:\n   - (A0, A0): You get 2, opponent gets 2.\n   - (A0, A1): You get 0, opponent gets 3.\n   - (A1, A0): You get 3, opponent gets 0.\n   - (A1, A1): You get 1, opponent gets 1.\n\n   This is similar to a \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game.

Actually, wait: this implies that A1 always gives a higher payoff by 1 regardless of q. So you should always prefer A1? But let's check:\n\n   Actually, compare:\n      If \\( q \\) is high (opponent likely plays A0), then A1 gives 3 vs A0 gives 2 -> prefer A1.\n      If \\( q \\) is low (opponent likely plays A1), then A1 gives 1 vs A0 gives 0 -> prefer A1.\n\n   So indeed, A1 is always better for you. Therefore, your best response is to always play A1 (i.e., p=0 for A0, p=100 for A1). However, note the cap from negotiation.\n\n4. **Cap Constraint**:\n   From previous negotiation, you agreed to a cap: {\"A0\"=100, \"A1\"=50}. This means you cannot assign more than 50% probability to A1. So you cannot play A1 with 100% even though it is dominant.\n\n   Therefore, you must set the probability for A1 to at most 50. Since A1 is strictly better, you should assign the maximum allowed to A1, i.e., 50% to A1 and thus 50% to A0.\n\n5. **Why not less?**:\n   If you assign less than 50% to A1, you are not maximizing your payoff. For example, if you assign 40% to A1 and 60% to A0, your expected payoff is lower than if you assign 50% to A1 and 50% to A0 (because A1 has higher payoff in all cases). So you should use the full cap for A1.\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   Given the cap: A1 <= 50, and since A1 is always better, we set:\n        A1 = 50 (the maximum allowed)\n        A0 = 50 (to sum to 100)\n\n7. **Output**:\n   We need to output a JSON with probabilities as integers summing to 100.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n{\"A0\": 50, \"A1\": 50}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 50, \"A1\": 50}\n```", "new_cap": [100, 50], "name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 2}, {"response": "{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}", "new_cap": [100, 0], "name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 2}], [{"response": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Game**: This is a simultaneous-move game with two players (you and an opponent).

So no mixed strategy? Wait, that can't be.\n\n   Actually, for the opponent to be indifferent, we need:\n        Expected payoff from A0 = Expected payoff from A1\n        => 2p = 3p + 1*(1-p)   [because if opponent plays A0, gets 2 if you play A0, 0 if you play A1; if A1, gets 3 if you A0, 1 if you A1]\n        => 2p = 3p + 1 - p\n        => 2p = 2p + 1\n        => 0=1 -> contradiction.\n\n   This means there is no mixed strategy Nash where both are indifferent. Actually, the pure Nash equilibria are (A0,A1) and (A1,A0)? But check:\n        (A0,A1): you get 0, opponent gets 3 -> not equilibrium because you would deviate to A1 to get 1? Actually if you switch to A1, you get 1 (better than 0). So (A0,A1) is not Nash.\n        Similarly (A1,A0): you get 3, opponent gets 0 -> opponent would switch to A1 to get 1 (better than 0).\n        (A0,A0): both get 2. If you switch to A1, you get 3 (better) so not Nash.\n        (A1,A1): both get 1. If you switch to A0, you get 0 (worse) so not beneficial. Similarly opponent same. So (A1,A1) is Nash.\n\n   Actually, (A1,A1) is a pure Nash equilibrium: no one has incentive to deviate.\n\n   But wait: if both play A1, both get 1. If you deviate to A0, you get 0 (worse). Similarly for opponent. So yes.\n   Also, there is another mixed? Actually the calculation above showed no mixed.\n\n   So the only pure Nash is (A1,A1).

So your probability for A1 must be <=50%, and for A0 must be >=50% (since they sum to 100).\n\n   So you are forced to play A0 at least 50% of the time.\n\n5. **What should you do?**\n   Given the cap, you cannot play the Nash equilibrium (A1 with 100%) because you are capped at 50% for A1.\n   So you must play at least 50% A0.\n\n   How to maximize your score given the constraint?\n   Let p = prob you play A0 (so p>=50), and let q = prob opponent plays A0.\n\n   Your expected payoff:\n        U = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n          = p*(2q) + (1-p)*(q*3 + 1 - q)\n          = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q+1)\n          = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n          = 2q + 1 - p\n\n   So your payoff is: 2q + 1 - p.\n\n   Since you want to maximize this, and you control p (with constraint p>=50), and you don't control q.\n\n   To maximize, you want to minimize p (because it has negative coefficient) and maximize q (but you don't control it).\n\n   So to maximize your payoff, you should choose the smallest p allowed, which is p=50 (so 50% A0, 50% A1).\n\n   Why? Because U = 2q + 1 - p. For any q, a lower p gives higher U.\n\n   Therefore, you should set:\n        A0: 50%, A1: 50%\n\n   This meets the cap: A1=50 (which is the maximum allowed) and A0=50 (which is at least 50).\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   You propose: {\"A0\": 50, \"A1\": 50}\n\n   Note: This is subject to the cap: A1=50 (exactly the cap) and A0=50 (which is within the cap of 100).\n\n   This maximizes your expected payoff regardless of what the opponent does.\n\nLet me verify with the formula:\n   If opponent plays A0 always (q=1): U = 2*1 + 1 - 0.5 = 2 + 1 - 0.5 = 2.5\n   If opponent plays A1 always (q=0): U = 0 + 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n   If you had chosen p=100 (all A0), then:\n        if q=1: U=2*1+1-1=2\n        if q=0: U=0+1-1=0\n   So indeed p=50 gives higher payoff in both cases.\n\nTherefore, the best is to set A0=50, A1=50.\n```json\n{\"A0\": 50, \"A1\": 50}\n```", "new_cap": [100, 50], "name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 3}, {"response": "{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}", "new_cap": [100, 0], "name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 0}]]

Let:\n   - You choose A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p).\n   - Opponent chooses A0 with probability q, A1 with (1-q).\n\n   Your expected payoff: \n   E = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n      = 2pq + 3q(1-p) + (1-p)(1-q)\n      = 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq\n      = (2pq - 3pq + pq) + (3q - q) + 1 - p\n      = 0 + 2q + 1 - p\n\n   Actually, let's recalc carefully:\n   E = 2pq + 0*p(1-q) + 3(1-p)q + 1*(1-p)(1-q)\n      = 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq\n      = (2pq - 3pq + pq) + (3q - q) + 1 - p\n      = 0*pq + 2q + 1 - p\n\n   So E = 1 - p + 2q.\n\n   Similarly, opponent's expected payoff is symmetric: E_opp = 1 - q + 2p.\n\n   In Nash equilibrium, each player chooses a strategy that makes the other indifferent. So set derivative of E_opp w.r.t. q to zero (to make opponent indifferent between A0 and A1):\n   For opponent: E_opp = q*(2p + (1-p)*0) + (1-q)*(p*3 + (1-p)*1)  [but wait, better to use our symmetric formula?]\n\n   Actually, from symmetry, the mixed Nash equilibrium should be symmetric: p = q.\n   Set p = q. Then for you to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\n   Payoff if you choose A0 (pure): 2*q + 0*(1-q) = 2q.\n   Payoff if you choose A1 (pure): 3*q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 1 + 2q.\n   For indifference: 2q = 1 + 2q  => 0=1, which is impossible. So there is no mixed strategy that makes you indifferent? Wait, that suggests a mistake.\n\n   Alternatively, compute the mixed strategy that makes the opponent indifferent:\n   Opponent's payoff when playing A0: 2*p + 0*(1-p) = 2p.\n   Opponent's payoff when playing A1: 0*p + 1*(1-p) = 1-p.\n   For indifference: 2p = 1-p  => 3p=1 => p=1/3.\n\n   Similarly, for you to be indifferent: \n   Your payoff when playing A0: 2*q.\n   Your payoff when playing A1: 1*(1-q) + 3*q? Wait, actually:\n   If you play A0: you get 2 if opponent A0, 0 if opponent A1 -> expected 2q.\n   If you play A1: you get 3 if opponent A0, 1 if opponent A1 -> expected 3q + 1*(1-q)=1+2q.\n   Set equal: 2q = 1+2q -> 0=1, contradiction.\n\n   This indicates that there is no mixed strategy that makes you indifferent. Actually, the game has two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A1) and (A1, A0), and one mixed Nash equilibrium where each plays A0 with probability 1/3 and A1 with probability 2/3? Let me check:\n\n   If opponent plays p=1/3 (A0) and 2/3 (A1):\n   Your payoff for A0: 2*(1/3) + 0*(2/3)=2/3.\n   Your payoff for A1: 3*(1/3) + 1*(2/3)=1 + 2/3=5/3.\n   So you prefer A1.\n\n   If opponent plays p=1/2:\n   A0: 2*0.5=1, A1: 3*0.5 + 1*0.5=1.5+0.5=2 -> still prefer A1.\n\n   If opponent plays p=0 (always A1):\n   A0: 0, A1: 1 -> prefer A1.\n\n   So actually, regardless of what opponent does, you always get a higher payoff by playing A1? Because:\n   E(A1) - E(A0) = [3q +1(1-q)] - [2q] = 3q+1-q -2q = 1.\n   So A1 always gives 1 more than A0. Therefore, A1 is a dominant strategy! Similarly for the opponent.\n\n   But wait, check: \n   If opponent plays A0: you get 2 for A0, 3 for A1 -> prefer A1.\n   If opponent plays A1: you get 0 for A0, 1 for A1 -> prefer A1.\n   So indeed, A1 is strictly dominant for both.\n\n   Therefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoff (1,1).\n\n3. **Cap Constraint**: From the previous round, you agreed to a cap: {\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}. This means you are not allowed to choose A1 at all in the next round? Because the cap for A1 is 0%. So you must choose A0 with 100% probability.\n\n4. **Proposal**: Given the cap, you cannot choose any positive probability for A1. Therefore, you must propose {\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}.\n\n5. **Why would you agree to such a cap?** Possibly because in repeated interactions, you might have negotiated to avoid the bad outcome (A1,A1) and aim for (A0,A0) which gives (2,2). But since the cap binds you to A0, you hope the opponent will also cooperate. However, note that the opponent has no cap mentioned? The cap only applies to you. The opponent might still choose any distribution.\n\n   But in this round, you are forced to play A0 with 100% probability. So your action is fixed to A0.\n\n6. **Expected Outcome**: \n   - If opponent chooses A0: you get 2.\n   - If opponent chooses A1: you get 0.\n\n   Since A1 is dominant for the opponent, they are likely to choose A1.

Each player chooses a probability distribution over these actions. The payoffs are symmetric in the sense that the game is actually a variant of the \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" (though not exactly classic, since mutual A1 gives (1,1) which is better than (0,0) but worse than mutual A0 (2,2)). However, note that:\n   - If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A0: (2,2)\n   - If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A1: (0,3)\n   - If you choose A1 and opponent chooses A0: (3,0)\n   - If you choose A1 and opponent chooses A1: (1,1)\n\n2. **Nash Equilibrium Analysis**:\n   - Let\u2019s denote your probability for A0 as p and for A1 as (1-p). Similarly, let the opponent's probability for A0 be q and for A1 be (1-q).\n   - Your expected payoff is: \n        U = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n          = p [2q] + (1-p)[3q + 1 - q]\n          = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n          = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n          = 2q + 1 - p   [Wait, this simplification seems off. Let me recalculate carefully.]\n\n   Actually, expand:\n        U = p*(2q) + (1-p)*(3q + 1*(1-q)) \n          = 2pq + (1-p)*(3q + 1 - q)\n          = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q + 1)\n          = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n          = 2q + 1 - p\n\n   So your expected payoff is: U = 2q + 1 - p.\n\n   Similarly, the opponent's expected payoff is symmetric: V = 2p + 1 - q.\n\n   To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to see what choices are best responses.\n\n   - For you: Your payoff U = 2q + 1 - p. Since this is linear in p, to maximize U you want to minimize p (because coefficient of p is -1). So regardless of q, you should set p as low as possible. That is, you should always choose A1 (p=0).\n\n   Similarly, for the opponent: V = 2p + 1 - q. To maximize V, they want to minimize q. So they should always choose A1 (q=0).\n\n   Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is both choosing A1 with probability 1, leading to payoffs (1,1).\n\n3. **Previous Agreement and Cap**:\n   From the previous round, you agreed to a cap: {\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}. This means that in the next round, you are allowed to choose A0 with probability at most 100% (so no restriction) and A1 with probability at most 0% (so you cannot choose A1 at all). Therefore, you are forced to choose A0 with probability 100%.\n\n4. **Proposing a New Probability Distribution**:\n   Given the cap, you have no choice: you must assign probability 100% to A0 and 0% to A1. Even though the Nash equilibrium suggests playing A1, the cap binds you to A0.\n\n   However, note that the cap is the result of a previous negotiation. Since you are forced to play A0, your payoff will depend on what the opponent does:\n   - If opponent plays A0: you get 2.\n   - If opponent plays A1: you get 0.\n\n   Ideally, you would like the opponent to also play A0. But since the opponent is rational (and without any cap), they will choose A1 (because it dominates: playing A1 gives 3 if you play A0, and 1 if you play A1, which is better than 2 and 0 respectively). So you should expect the opponent to play A1, and you will get 0.\n\n   But wait: the cap is for you only. The opponent may not have a cap? The problem says \"you agree to have a cap\", meaning it applies to you. The opponent might have their own cap? But it is not specified. So we assume the opponent has no cap and is rational.\n\n   Therefore, knowing that you are forced to play A0, the opponent will definitely play A1 to get 3. So you will get 0.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   You have no freedom due to the cap: you must set A0=100 and A1=0.\n\n   Even though this leads to a bad outcome for you (0 points), you must comply with the cap.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}\n```", "new_cap": [100, 0], "name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 0}], [{"response": "**Step 1 \u2013 Understand the cap constraints**  \nThe cap limits the maximum probability we can assign to each action in the next round.  \n- For **A0** the cap is 0\u202f%.  \n- For **A1** the cap is 100\u202f%.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Translate caps into a feasible distribution**  \nSince A0 cannot be chosen at all (0\u202f% max), we must set its probability to 0.  \nAll remaining probability must go to A1, and the cap allows up to 100\u202f%.  \nThus the only distribution that satisfies both the cap and the requirement that the two probabilities sum to 100 is:\n\n- A0 = 0  \n- A1 = 100  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Verify**  \n- A0 \u2264 0\u202f% \u2714\ufe0f  \n- A1 \u2264 100\u202f% \u2714\ufe0f  \n- 0 + 100 = 100 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\n**Final JSON output**\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```\n", "new_cap": [0, 100], "name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 3}, {"response": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Game**: This is a simultaneous-move game where both players choose a probability distribution over actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are symmetric and represent a classic \"coordination\" game with a twist:\n   - (A0, A0): Both get 2 (good outcome for cooperation).\n   - (A0, A1): You get 0, opponent gets 3 (worst for you, best for opponent).\n   - (A1, A0): You get 3, opponent gets 0 (best for you, worst for opponent).\n   - (A1, A1): Both get 1 (lesser cooperative outcome).\n\n2. **Nash Equilibrium Analysis**:\n   - There are two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1). However, (A0,A0) gives higher payoff (2,2) compared to (1,1) at (A1,A1).\n   - There is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Let p be the probability you choose A0, and q be the probability opponent chooses A0.\n     - Your expected payoff: \n        U_you = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n             = 2pq + 3q(1-p) + (1-p)(1-q)\n             = 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq\n             = (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q - q - p + 1\n             = 0 + 2q - p + 1\n     - Actually, let me compute properly:\n        U_you = 2pq + 0*p(1-q) + 3(1-p)q + 1(1-p)(1-q)\n             = 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq\n             = (2pq - 3pq + pq) + (3q - q) - p + 1\n             = 0 + 2q - p + 1\n     - Similarly, opponent's expected payoff:\n        U_opp = 2pq + 3p(1-q) + 0*(1-p)q + 1(1-p)(1-q)\n             = 2pq + 3p - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq\n             = (2pq - 3pq + pq) + (3p - p) - q + 1\n             = 0 + 2p - q + 1\n\n   - To find mixed NE, we set the derivative such that you are indifferent between actions:\n        Expected payoff if you choose A0: 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\n        Expected payoff if you choose A1: 3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n     - So you always get higher payoff by choosing A1 (since 2q+1 > 2q for all q). Similarly, opponent always gets higher payoff by choosing A1 (since 2p+1 > 2p for all p). Therefore, the only Nash equilibrium is both playing A1 with probability 1? But wait, that would be (A1,A1) which is a pure NE.\n\n   Actually, let me check the indifference condition properly:\n   For you to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\n        2q = 3q + 1 - q   => 2q = 2q + 1 => 0=1, which is impossible.\n   So there is no mixed strategy where both are indifferent. This means the only Nash equilibria are the pure ones: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).\n\n3. **Previous Agreement and Cap**:\n   - From the previous round, you agreed to a cap: {\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}. This means you are forced to play A0 with probability 100% and A1 with 0%. This is essentially committing to always play A0.\n   - Now, you are to propose a new probability distribution subject to this cap. Since the cap allows A0 up to 100% and A1 at 0%, you cannot choose any positive probability for A1. So you must set A0=100 and A1=0.\n\n4. **Why would you agree to such a cap?**:\n   - If you commit to A0, then the opponent's best response is to also choose A0 (to get 2) rather than A1 (which gives them 0). So this leads to the (A0,A0) outcome which gives you 2 points. This is better than the (A1,A1) outcome which gives only 1.\n   - However, if the opponent defects and plays A1, you get 0. But since you are committed to A0, the opponent has an incentive to cooperate (play A0) to get 2 rather than 0. So this cap is a way to force the cooperative outcome.\n\n5. **Current Proposal**:\n   - Given the cap, you cannot propose any other distribution than {\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}. So you must stick to this.\n\nTherefore, the only valid proposal under the cap is to choose A0 with 100% probability.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 100, \"A1\": 0}\n```", "new_cap": [100, 0], "name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 0}]]
