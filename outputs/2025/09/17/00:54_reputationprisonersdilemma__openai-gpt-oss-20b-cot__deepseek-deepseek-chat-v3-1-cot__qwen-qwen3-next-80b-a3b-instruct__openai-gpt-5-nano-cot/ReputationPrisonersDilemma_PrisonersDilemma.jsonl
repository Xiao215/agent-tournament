So this is a **non-zero-sum game** with asymmetric incentives.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Game Type\n\nThis resembles a **variant of the Battle of the Sexes** or a **Chicken-like game**, but let\u2019s analyze it as a **simultaneous-move game with mixed strategies**.\n\nWe want to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (i.e., p = P(A0), 1-p = P(A1)) that **maximizes our expected payoff**, assuming the opponent is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: **we don\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s strategy**, and we move simultaneously. So we need to consider:\n\n- What is the best response to any opponent strategy?\n- Can we find a Nash Equilibrium (NE)?\n- Since we\u2019re trying to maximize our own score, and there\u2019s no repeated interaction or reputation feedback yet (reputation data is unavailable), we should aim for a **Nash Equilibrium** \u2014 the rational, stable outcome.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the opponent plays A0 with probability `q` and A1 with probability `1\u2212q`.\n\nOur expected payoff if we play A0:\n- E[A0] = q * 2 + (1\u2212q) * 0 = 2q\n\nOur expected payoff if we play A1:\n- E[A1] = q * 3 + (1\u2212q) * 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nWe are indifferent between A0 and A1 when:\n> E[A0] = E[A1]  \n> 2q = 2q + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 **Impossible**\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be. Let\u2019s double-check:\n\nE[A0] = 2q + 0*(1\u2212q) = 2q  \nE[A1] = 3q + 1*(1\u2212q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSo E[A1] = E[A0] + 1 \u2192 **A1 always gives 1 more point than A0**, regardless of q!\n\nThat means: **No matter what the opponent does, playing A1 gives a strictly higher expected payoff than A0**.\n\nLet\u2019s verify with examples:\n\n- If opponent plays A0 with 100% (q=1):  \n  - A0 \u2192 2  \n  - A1 \u2192 3 \u2192 better\n\n- If opponent plays A1 with 100% (q=0):  \n  - A0 \u2192 0  \n  - A1 \u2192 1 \u2192 better\n\n- If opponent plays 50-50:  \n  - A0 \u2192 1  \n  - A1 \u2192 2 \u2192 better\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0** for the player.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion \u2014 Dominant Strategy\n\nSince A1 gives a **strictly higher payoff than A0** regardless of the opponent\u2019s action, **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy**.\n\nTherefore, the rational choice is to play **A1 with 100% probability**.\n\nEven if the opponent also realizes this (and plays A1), the payoff is (1,1) \u2014 which is worse than (2,2), but we can\u2019t get (2,2) unless we play A0, which is riskier and strictly dominated.\n\nIn non-cooperative game theory, we assume players act in their own self-interest and choose dominant strategies when available.\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\n\nWe should choose **A1 with probability 100%**, because it\u2019s the only strategy that maximizes our expected payoff regardless of the opponent\u2019s move.\n\nThis is also the unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies.\n\n> Note: Even though (A0,A0) gives a higher joint payoff (2,2), it is not stable \u2014 because either player can unilaterally deviate to A1 and increase their payoff from 2 to 3.\n\nSo the rational, self-interested, equilibrium choice is A1 with 100% probability.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

We can look for a Nash Equilibrium in mixed strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Let\u2019s denote our strategy\nLet:\n- p = probability we choose A0\n- (1-p) = probability we choose A1\n\nLet the opponent choose:\n- q = probability opponent chooses A0\n- (1-q) = probability opponent chooses A1\n\nOur expected payoff is:\n\nE = p * [q * 2 + (1-q) * 0] + (1-p) * [q * 3 + (1-q) * 1]\n\nSimplify:\n\nE = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]  \nE = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)  \nE = 2pq + (2q + 1 - 2pq - p)  \nE = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p  \nE = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait \u2014 that simplifies nicely!\n\nSo:  \n**Our expected payoff = 2q + 1 - p**\n\nBut this is our payoff as a function of our own p and opponent\u2019s q.\n\nBut we are choosing p to maximize our payoff, and the opponent is choosing q to maximize *their* payoff.\n\nSo we need to find a Nash Equilibrium: a pair (p*, q*) such that neither player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find opponent\u2019s best response to our p\n\nLet\u2019s compute the opponent\u2019s expected payoff given our p.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff:\n\nIf opponent chooses A0:  \n- With prob p: we choose A0 \u2192 opponent gets 2  \n- With prob (1-p): we choose A1 \u2192 opponent gets 0  \n\u2192 Expected payoff if opponent plays A0: 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p\n\nIf opponent chooses A1:  \n- With prob p: we choose A0 \u2192 opponent gets 3  \n- With prob (1-p): we choose A1 \u2192 opponent gets 1  \n\u2192 Expected payoff if opponent plays A1: 3p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo opponent\u2019s expected payoff:\n- A0: 2p  \n- A1: 2p + 1\n\nNotice: **2p + 1 > 2p** for all p.\n\nSo no matter what p we choose, the opponent\u2019s expected payoff from A1 is always 1 point higher than from A0.\n\nTherefore, **the opponent\u2019s dominant strategy is to always play A1** (i.e., q = 0).\n\nThis is critical.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Given opponent always plays A1, what should we do?\n\nIf opponent plays A1 with probability 1 (q=0), then our payoffs are:\n\n- If we play A0: get 0  \n- If we play A1: get 1\n\nSo we should play A1 with probability 1 to get 1 point instead of 0.\n\nThus, the unique Nash Equilibrium is:\n\n- We play A1 with probability 1  \n- Opponent plays A1 with probability 1  \n\nResult: (A1, A1) \u2192 both get 1 point.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is this the *only* equilibrium?\n\nLet\u2019s check if there\u2019s a mixed strategy equilibrium.\n\nSuppose the opponent is mixing. For them to be indifferent between A0 and A1, their expected payoffs must be equal.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff from A0: 2p  \nOpponent\u2019s payoff from A1: 2p + 1\n\nSet equal:  \n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo **no mixed strategy equilibrium exists** where opponent is mixing.\n\nThe opponent always strictly prefers A1, regardless of our strategy.\n\nTherefore, **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for the opponent**.\n\nGiven that, we should best respond by playing A1 as well.\n\nSo the rational play is: **we play A1 with probability 1**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Consider reputation?\n\nThe note says:  \n> Your chosen action will affect your reputation score.\n\nBut we have **no reputation data available**. So we cannot condition on past behavior. We must assume the opponent is rational and will play their dominant strategy (A1), and we should best respond.\n\nEven if the opponent is not perfectly rational, since A1 is strictly dominant, it\u2019s the safest assumption.\n\nAlso, if we play A0, we get 0 if opponent plays A1 (which they will), and only 2 if they play A0 \u2014 but they have no incentive to play A0.\n\nSo playing A0 is risky and gives lower expected payoff.\n\nThus, **optimal strategy: play A1 with 100% probability**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer Format\n\nWe must output a JSON with A0 and A1 probabilities as integers from 0 to 100, summing to 100.\n\nSo:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": ""}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": ""}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|                   | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0            | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1            | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.

So set p = q.\n\nThen our expected payoff becomes: E = 2p + 1 - p = p + 1.\n\nThis increases with p, so we would want to set p as high as possible? But wait, we need to find the Nash equilibrium.\n\nIn mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, each player should be indifferent between the two pure strategies.\n\nSo for us to be indifferent between A0 and A1, the expected payoff from A0 should equal that from A1.\n\nExpected payoff if we play A0: 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\nExpected payoff if we play A1: 3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSet them equal: 2q = 2q + 1  => 0=1, which is impossible.\n\nThis means there is no mixed strategy where we are indifferent. Actually, we always get 1 more by playing A1 regardless of q: because 2q+1 > 2q for all q.\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0? Let's check:\n\nIf opponent plays A0: we get 3 for A1 vs 2 for A0 -> A1 better.\nIf opponent plays A1: we get 1 for A1 vs 0 for A0 -> A1 better.\n\nSo indeed, A1 is strictly better than A0 regardless of what the opponent does.

To maximize our payoff, we want to minimize p (since it has a negative coefficient) and maximize q (since it has a positive coefficient). However, we cannot control q; we can only choose p.\n\nThis is a mixed strategy game. We should look for a Nash equilibrium where both players use the same strategy (since the game is symmetric).\n\nLet the common mixed strategy be (p, 1-p) for both players.\n\nThen, the expected payoff for a player when they choose A0 is:\nE(A0) = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n\nThe expected payoff for choosing A1 is:\nE(A1) = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nFor a mixed strategy to be optimal, the expected payoffs from both actions should be equal (otherwise, we would want to put all probability on the better action). So set E(A0) = E(A1):\n2p = 2p + 1\n=> 0 = 1, which is impossible.\n\nThis indicates that there is no mixed strategy where both actions are equally good. In fact, E(A1) = 2p+1 is always greater than E(A0)=2p by 1. Therefore, A1 strictly dominates A0? Let's check:\n\nFor any p (which is between 0 and 1), E(A1) = 2p+1 > 2p = E(A0). So indeed, A1 always gives a higher expected payoff than A0, regardless of what the opponent does.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to always choose A1. That is, set p=0 for A0 and 1 for A1.\n\nBut wait, let's verify with the payoffs:\n- If we always choose A1 and opponent always chooses A1: we get 1.\n- If we always choose A1 and opponent always chooses A0: we get 3.\n- If we choose A0 and opponent chooses A1: we get 0.\n- If we choose A0 and opponent chooses A0: we get 2.\n\nBut since A1 always gives at least 1 (and can give 3) while A0 gives at most 2 (and can give 0), A1 is indeed better.\n\nIn fact, A1 is a dominant strategy: it gives a higher payoff regardless of what the opponent does:\n- If opponent chooses A0: A1 gives 3 > 2 (from A0)\n- If opponent chooses A1: A1 gives 1 > 0 (from A0)\n\nSo, strictly dominant strategy: always choose A1.\n\nTherefore, we should set probability for A1 to 100% and A0 to 0%.\n\nThis maximizes our score because:\n- We avoid the risk of getting 0 (if we choose A0 and opponent chooses A1).\n- We guarantee at least 1, and possibly 3.\n\nSo the optimal distribution is {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Our expected payoff is:  \n**E = 2q + 1 - p**\n\nBut this depends on both p and q. We are choosing p, and we assume the opponent chooses q to maximize their own payoff.\n\nSo we need to find the Nash Equilibrium: a pair (p*, q*) such that each is a best response to the other.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find opponent\u2019s best response to our p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff when they play A0:  \nThey get 2 if we play A0, 0 if we play A1 \u2192 so:  \nE_opponent(A0) = p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff when they play A1:  \nThey get 3 if we play A0, 1 if we play A1 \u2192 so:  \nE_opponent(A1) = p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo opponent\u2019s payoff for A1 is always 1 more than for A0:  \nE_opponent(A1) = 2p + 1  \nE_opponent(A0) = 2p  \n\u2192 So **opponent always prefers A1**, no matter what p is.\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s critical.\n\nE_opponent(A1) - E_opponent(A0) = (2p + 1) - 2p = 1 > 0\n\nSo **regardless of what we do, the opponent gets 1 more point by playing A1 than A0**.\n\nTherefore, the opponent\u2019s **strictly dominant strategy** is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nSo we can assume the opponent will play:  \n**q = 0** (i.e., they play A1 with 100% probability)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Given opponent plays A1 with 100% probability, what should we do?\n\nIf opponent always plays A1, then:\n\n- If we play A0 \u2192 we get 0  \n- If we play A1 \u2192 we get 1\n\nSo we should play A1 with 100% probability to get 1 point instead of 0.\n\nThus, the unique Nash Equilibrium is:  \n**We play A1 with probability 1**  \n**Opponent plays A1 with probability 1**\n\nResult: (A1, A1) \u2192 both get 1 point.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a better outcome?  \nIf we could coordinate to play (A0, A0), we\u2019d both get 2 \u2014 better than 1.\n\nBut the opponent has a strictly dominant strategy to play A1.

But we must assume they are rational unless told otherwise (standard game theory assumption).\n\nAlso, the instruction says: \u201cYour chosen action will affect your reputation score.\u201d  \nBut we have no reputation data \u2014 so we must assume the opponent is rational and will play their dominant strategy.\n\nSo we must assume opponent plays A1 with probability 1.\n\nTherefore, our best response is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nExpected payoff: 1 point.\n\nIf we play A0, we get 0.\n\nSo we must play A1.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nWe play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nThus, our probability distribution:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nThis is the optimal strategy given the opponent\u2019s dominant strategy.\n\nEven though (A0, A0) gives a higher payoff (2), it\u2019s not achievable because the opponent has no incentive to play A0 \u2014 they always get more by playing A1.\n\nSo we must play A1.\n\n---\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.

But we must consider the opponent's response.\n\nActually, we should look for a Nash equilibrium where no player can improve by changing their strategy unilaterally.\n\nSuppose we fix the opponent's strategy q. Then our payoff U = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nSince U is decreasing in p (coefficient -1), to maximize U we should set p as small as possible. That is, p=0.\n\nBut if we set p=0 (always A1), then the opponent's payoff V = 2p + 1 - q = 1 - q (since p=0). To maximize V, the opponent should set q=0.\n\nSo if both play p=0, q=0 (always A1), then payoffs are (1,1). Is this an equilibrium?\n\nIf we deviate to p>0, our payoff becomes U = 2*0 + 1 - p = 1 - p < 1. So we are worse off. Similarly for the opponent. So (A1 always) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut is there another equilibrium?

The only Nash equilibrium is both playing A1 with probability 1.\n\nSo we should choose A1 with 100% probability.\n\nBut let's confirm: if both always choose A1, we get (1,1). If we try to deviate to A0 when opponent always A1, we get 0 which is worse. Similarly for opponent.\n\nAlso, if both always choose A0, we get (2,2). But is that an equilibrium? If opponent always A0, we can deviate to A1 and get 3 which is better. So (A0 always) is not an equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1).\n\nSo we should set:\np(A0)=0, p(A1)=100.\n\nSince the opponent is also rational (and we have no reputation data), we assume they will play the equilibrium strategy as well.\n\nThus, our probability distribution should be {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}.\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.

It resembles a \"Chicken\" or \"Battle of the Sexes\" type game, but let's analyze it as a strategic interaction where we want to maximize our own expected payoff, assuming the opponent is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s denote:\n- Let p = probability I choose A0 (so 1-p = probability I choose A1)\n- Let q = probability opponent chooses A0 (so 1-q = probability opponent chooses A1)\n\nMy expected payoff is:\nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n\nSimplify:\nE = 2pq + 0 + 3q(1-p) + 1*(1-p)(1-q)\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + (1 - p - q + pq)\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q + 1 - p - q\n= 0*pq + 2q + 1 - p\n= 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be right.

What is my best response?\n\nE_me = 1 + 2q - p\n\nSince p is my choice (0 \u2264 p \u2264 1), and E_me is linear in p, and the coefficient of p is -1 (negative), then to maximize E_me, I want to make p as SMALL as possible \u2014 i.e., p = 0.\n\nWait \u2014 that suggests I should always play A1? But let\u2019s check.\n\nE_me = 1 + 2q - p \u2192 since -p, yes, to maximize, set p=0.\n\nBut if I set p=0 (always play A1), then opponent\u2019s payoff is E_opponent = 1 + 2*0 - q = 1 - q \u2192 so opponent wants to minimize q \u2192 set q=0.\n\nSo if I play p=0, opponent plays q=0 \u2192 both play A1 \u2192 payoff (1,1)\n\nBut is that a Nash equilibrium?\n\nCheck: If I play A1 (p=0), opponent plays A1 (q=0).

Then my payoff: E_me = 1 + 2*1 - p = 3 - p \u2192 to maximize, set p=0 \u2192 I play A1.\n\nBut if I play A1 and opponent plays A0, opponent gets 0. But if opponent switches to A1, they get 1.

Playing A1 always gives me 1 more than playing A0, regardless of q.\n\nSimilarly, for opponent:\n\nIf opponent plays A0: gets 2p + 3(1-p) = 2p + 3 - 3p = 3 - p  \nIf opponent plays A1: gets 0*p + 1*(1-p) = 1 - p\n\nSet equal: 3 - p = 1 - p \u2192 3 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo opponent is also never indifferent. Playing A0 always gives 2 more than playing A1, regardless of p.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be right.\n\nWait: opponent\u2019s payoff when playing A0:  \n- if I play A0 (prob p): opponent gets 2  \n- if I play A1 (prob 1-p): opponent gets 3  \n\u2192 so E_opponent(A0) = 2p + 3(1-p) = 3 - p\n\nWhen opponent plays A1:  \n- if I play A0: opponent gets 0  \n- if I play A1: opponent gets 1  \n\u2192 E_opponent(A1) = 0*p + 1*(1-p) = 1 - p\n\nNow compare: 3 - p vs 1 - p \u2192 difference is always 2. So opponent always gets 2 more by playing A0 than A1, no matter what I do.\n\nSo opponent\u2019s dominant strategy is A0.\n\nBut earlier I thought my best response is A1.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nIf opponent plays A0 (q=1):  \n- I get 2 if I play A0  \n- I get 3 if I play A1 \u2192 so I prefer A1\n\nIf opponent plays A1 (q=0):  \n- I get 0 if I play A0  \n- I get 1 if I play A1 \u2192 so I prefer A1\n\nSo no matter what opponent does, I prefer A1 \u2192 A1 is my dominant strategy.\n\nOpponent:  \nIf I play A0 (p=1):  \n- opponent gets 2 if they play A0  \n- opponent gets 0 if they play A1 \u2192 prefers A0\n\nIf I play A1 (p=0):  \n- opponent gets 3 if they play A0  \n- opponent gets 1 if they play A1 \u2192 prefers A0\n\nSo opponent always prefers A0 \u2192 A0 is their dominant strategy.\n\nSo we have:\n\n- I have dominant strategy: A1  \n- Opponent has dominant strategy: A0\n\nSo the unique Nash equilibrium is: I play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 outcome (A1, A0) \u2192 I get 3, opponent gets 0.\n\nThis is the only rational outcome.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the problem says: \"You and the opponent each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.\"\n\nAnd we are to output a probability distribution.\n\nSince A1 is my dominant strategy, I should play A1 with probability 1.\n\nSo I should choose: A0: 0%, A1: 100%\n\nBut let\u2019s check the reputation note:  \n\"qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/5 rounds (0.00%)\"  \nIt says this twice \u2014 perhaps indicating that in the past, I have never played A0.\n\nSo if I play A1 with 100% probability, that\u2019s consistent with past behavior.\n\nAnd since A1 is my dominant strategy, it\u2019s optimal.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1. The payoff matrix is:\n\n- (A0, A0): (2, 2)\n- (A0, A1): (0, 3)\n- (A1, A0): (3, 0)\n- (A1, A1): (1, 1)\n\nThis is a classic 2-player, 2-action game. It resembles a \"Chicken\" or \"Battle of the Sexes\" type game, but let's analyze it as a strategic interaction where we want to maximize our own expected payoff, assuming the opponent is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s denote:\n- Let p = probability I choose A0 (so 1-p = probability I choose A1)\n- Let q = probability opponent chooses A0 (so 1-q = probability opponent chooses A1)\n\nMy expected payoff is:\nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n\nSimplify:\nE = 2pq + 0 + 3q(1-p) + 1*(1-p)(1-q)\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + (1 - p - q + pq)\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q + 1 - p - q\n= 0*pq + 2q + 1 - p\n= 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be right. Let me recompute carefully:\n\nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n\n= 2pq + 0 + 3q(1-p) + 1*(1-p)(1-q)\n\nNow expand:\n\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + (1 - p - q + pq)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\npq terms: 2pq - 3pq + pq = 0\n\nq terms: 3q - q = 2q\n\np terms: -p\n\nconstants: +1\n\nSo E = 2q - p + 1\n\nInteresting! My expected payoff is E = 1 + 2q - p\n\nThis means:\n- My payoff increases as q increases (opponent plays A0 more)\n- My payoff decreases as p increases (I play A0 more)\n\nSo if I play A0 more (higher p), I get less \u2014 unless the opponent is playing A0 a lot.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: the opponent is also rational. What is their best response?\n\nLet\u2019s compute the opponent\u2019s expected payoff.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff:\n- (A0,A0): 2\n- (A0,A1): 3\n- (A1,A0): 0\n- (A1,A1): 1\n\nSo opponent\u2019s expected payoff:\n\nE_opponent = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*3 + (1-p)*q*0 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n\n= 2pq + 3p(1-q) + 0 + (1-p)(1-q)\n\n= 2pq + 3p - 3pq + (1 - p - q + pq)\n\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3p - p - q + 1\n\n= 0*pq + 2p - q + 1\n\nSo E_opponent = 1 + 2p - q\n\nNow we have:\n\nMy payoff: E_me = 1 + 2q - p  \nOpponent\u2019s payoff: E_opponent = 1 + 2p - q\n\nWe are both trying to maximize our own payoff.\n\nThis is a symmetric game in structure, but not symmetric in payoffs \u2014 it\u2019s actually a variant of the \"Matching Pennies\" with asymmetric payoffs.\n\nLet\u2019s look for Nash equilibrium.\n\nIn Nash equilibrium, each player\u2019s strategy is a best response to the other.\n\nSuppose the opponent plays q. What is my best response?\n\nE_me = 1 + 2q - p\n\nSince p is my choice (0 \u2264 p \u2264 1), and E_me is linear in p, and the coefficient of p is -1 (negative), then to maximize E_me, I want to make p as SMALL as possible \u2014 i.e., p = 0.\n\nWait \u2014 that suggests I should always play A1? But let\u2019s check.\n\nE_me = 1 + 2q - p \u2192 since -p, yes, to maximize, set p=0.\n\nBut if I set p=0 (always play A1), then opponent\u2019s payoff is E_opponent = 1 + 2*0 - q = 1 - q \u2192 so opponent wants to minimize q \u2192 set q=0.\n\nSo if I play p=0, opponent plays q=0 \u2192 both play A1 \u2192 payoff (1,1)\n\nBut is that a Nash equilibrium?\n\nCheck: If I play A1 (p=0), opponent plays A1 (q=0). If I deviate to A0 (p=1), my payoff becomes: 1 + 2*0 - 1 = 0 \u2192 worse than 1. So I don\u2019t want to deviate.\n\nIf opponent deviates to q=1 (play A0), their payoff becomes: 1 + 2*0 - 1 = 0 \u2192 worse than 1. So they don\u2019t want to deviate.\n\nSo (p=0, q=0) \u2192 both play A1 \u2014 is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut is there another?\n\nSuppose opponent plays q=1 (always A0). Then my payoff: E_me = 1 + 2*1 - p = 3 - p \u2192 to maximize, set p=0 \u2192 I play A1.\n\nBut if I play A1 and opponent plays A0, opponent gets 0. But if opponent switches to A1, they get 1. So opponent would prefer to switch. So (p=0, q=1) is NOT equilibrium.\n\nWhat if opponent plays q=0.5?\n\nThen my E_me = 1 + 2*(0.5) - p = 2 - p \u2192 still maximized at p=0.\n\nSo no matter what q is, E_me = 1 + 2q - p \u2192 since coefficient of p is negative, best response is always p=0.\n\nSimilarly, for opponent: E_opponent = 1 + 2p - q \u2192 coefficient of q is -1 \u2192 so best response is always q=0.\n\nSo the unique Nash equilibrium is p=0, q=0 \u2192 both play A1 with probability 1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 let\u2019s check if there\u2019s a mixed strategy equilibrium.\n\nSuppose I mix p, and opponent mixes q, and both are indifferent.\n\nFor me to be indifferent between A0 and A1, the expected payoff from A0 must equal that from A1.\n\nIf I play A0: I get 2*q + 0*(1-q) = 2q  \nIf I play A1: I get 3*q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSet equal: 2q = 2q + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo I am NEVER indifferent. Playing A1 always gives me 1 more than playing A0, regardless of q.\n\nSimilarly, for opponent:\n\nIf opponent plays A0: gets 2p + 3(1-p) = 2p + 3 - 3p = 3 - p  \nIf opponent plays A1: gets 0*p + 1*(1-p) = 1 - p\n\nSet equal: 3 - p = 1 - p \u2192 3 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo opponent is also never indifferent. Playing A0 always gives 2 more than playing A1, regardless of p.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be right.\n\nWait: opponent\u2019s payoff when playing A0:  \n- if I play A0 (prob p): opponent gets 2  \n- if I play A1 (prob 1-p): opponent gets 3  \n\u2192 so E_opponent(A0) = 2p + 3(1-p) = 3 - p\n\nWhen opponent plays A1:  \n- if I play A0: opponent gets 0  \n- if I play A1: opponent gets 1  \n\u2192 E_opponent(A1) = 0*p + 1*(1-p) = 1 - p\n\nNow compare: 3 - p vs 1 - p \u2192 difference is always 2. So opponent always gets 2 more by playing A0 than A1, no matter what I do.\n\nSo opponent\u2019s dominant strategy is A0.\n\nBut earlier I thought my best response is A1.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nIf opponent plays A0 (q=1):  \n- I get 2 if I play A0  \n- I get 3 if I play A1 \u2192 so I prefer A1\n\nIf opponent plays A1 (q=0):  \n- I get 0 if I play A0  \n- I get 1 if I play A1 \u2192 so I prefer A1\n\nSo no matter what opponent does, I prefer A1 \u2192 A1 is my dominant strategy.\n\nOpponent:  \nIf I play A0 (p=1):  \n- opponent gets 2 if they play A0  \n- opponent gets 0 if they play A1 \u2192 prefers A0\n\nIf I play A1 (p=0):  \n- opponent gets 3 if they play A0  \n- opponent gets 1 if they play A1 \u2192 prefers A0\n\nSo opponent always prefers A0 \u2192 A0 is their dominant strategy.\n\nSo we have:\n\n- I have dominant strategy: A1  \n- Opponent has dominant strategy: A0\n\nSo the unique Nash equilibrium is: I play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 outcome (A1, A0) \u2192 I get 3, opponent gets 0.\n\nThis is the only rational outcome.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the problem says: \"You and the opponent each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.\"\n\nAnd we are to output a probability distribution.\n\nSince A1 is my dominant strategy, I should play A1 with probability 1.\n\nSo I should choose: A0: 0%, A1: 100%\n\nBut let\u2019s check the reputation note:  \n\"qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/5 rounds (0.00%)\"  \nIt says this twice \u2014 perhaps indicating that in the past, I have never played A0.\n\nSo if I play A1 with 100% probability, that\u2019s consistent with past behavior.\n\nAnd since A1 is my dominant strategy, it\u2019s optimal.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, 2-action simultaneous game with the following payoffs for **you** (the row player):\n\n| You \\ Opponent | A0       | A1       |\n|----------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**         | 2        | 0        |\n| **A1**         | 3        | 1        |\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs are symmetric but not identical:\n- When you choose A0 and opponent A0: opponent gets 2\n- When you choose A0 and opponent A1: opponent gets 3\n- When you choose A1 and opponent A0: opponent gets 0\n- When you choose A1 and opponent A1: opponent gets 1\n\nSo the opponent\u2019s payoffs are:\n| You \\ Opponent | A0 | A1 |\n|----------------|----|----|\n| **A0**         | 2  | 3  |\n| **A1**         | 0  | 1  |\n\nThis is a **non-zero-sum** game, and importantly, **not symmetric** in payoffs.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify Best Responses\n\nWe want to choose a **mixed strategy** (probability distribution over A0 and A1) that maximizes our **expected payoff**, assuming the opponent is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.\n\nBut note: we don\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s strategy yet. However, we are told the **reputation** of the opponent (openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)) has played A0 in 0/5 rounds \u2014 meaning they have **never** played A0. And we (qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)) have also played A0 in 0/5 rounds.\n\nThis suggests that **both players have a history of always playing A1**.\n\nThis is critical.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Infer Opponent\u2019s Likely Strategy\n\nGiven that the opponent has played A1 in all 5 previous rounds, it is **highly likely** they will continue playing A1 in this round \u2014 either because they are stuck in a pattern, or because they believe A1 is optimal.\n\nLet\u2019s test that assumption.\n\nIf the opponent plays **A1 with probability 1**, then our expected payoffs are:\n\n- If we play A0: 0 points\n- If we play A1: 1 point\n\nSo **A1 is better** (1 > 0). So if opponent plays A1 always, we should play A1.\n\nBut what if the opponent is **not** always playing A1? Maybe they are learning or will change?\n\nWe need to think strategically.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find Nash Equilibrium (Optimal Strategy)\n\nLet\u2019s find the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.\n\nLet:\n- You play A0 with probability `p`, A1 with probability `1-p`\n- Opponent plays A0 with probability `q`, A1 with probability `1-q`\n\nWe want to find `p` such that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1 (so they have no incentive to deviate), and vice versa.\n\nBut since we are trying to **maximize our own score**, and we don\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s strategy, we can either:\n\n1. Assume the opponent is playing a fixed strategy (based on history), or\n2. Play the Nash equilibrium strategy to be robust.\n\nLet\u2019s do both.\n\n---\n\n#### Option A: Assume Opponent Plays A1 with 100% probability (based on history)\n\nThen:\n- Your expected payoff for A0: 0\n- Your expected payoff for A1: 1\n\n\u2192 So you should play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nThis gives you 1 point per round.\n\nBut is this optimal? Maybe you can exploit if opponent changes?\n\nBut opponent has played A1 5 times. If they are rational, they might be playing a best response to you.\n\nWait \u2014 what is the opponent\u2019s best response to you?\n\nLet\u2019s find the opponent\u2019s best response to your strategy.\n\nSuppose you play A0 with probability `p`, A1 with `1-p`.\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff for playing A0:\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff for playing A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nCompare:\n- A0 gives 2p\n- A1 gives 2p + 1 \u2192 always 1 more than A0\n\nSo **no matter what p you choose**, the opponent\u2019s expected payoff from A1 is **always 1 point higher** than from A0.\n\n\u2192 Therefore, **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for the opponent**.\n\nThey will **always** play A1, regardless of what you do.\n\nThat\u2019s huge.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Your Best Response to Opponent\u2019s Dominant Strategy\n\nSince the opponent **always** plays A1 (strictly dominant strategy), your best response is to choose the action that gives you the highest payoff when opponent plays A1.\n\nFrom the matrix:\n- If opponent plays A1:\n  - You play A0 \u2192 you get 0\n  - You play A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nSo **A1 is strictly better** for you too.\n\n\u2192 Therefore, **your best response is to play A1 with 100% probability**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Reputation Consideration\n\nThe reputation log says:\n- openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT): played A0 in 0/5 \u2192 always A1\n- qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): played A0 in 0/5 \u2192 always A1\n\nSo you are already on the same path. Continuing to play A1 is consistent with your reputation and optimal strategy.\n\nThere is **no incentive** to switch to A0 \u2014 it gives you 0 when opponent plays A1, which they always do.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Final Decision\n\nYou should play A1 with probability 100%, A0 with 0%.\n\nThis maximizes your expected payoff (1 point per round), and is consistent with both game theory and observed behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer (JSON format):\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1. The payoff matrix is:\n\n- (A0, A0): (2, 2)\n- (A0, A1): (0, 3)\n- (A1, A0): (3, 0)\n- (A1, A1): (1, 1)\n\nThis is a classic 2-player, 2-action game. It resembles a \"Chicken\" or \"Battle of the Sexes\" type game, but let\u2019s analyze it as a normal-form game to find the optimal mixed strategy.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the game structure\n\nYour payoff:\n- If you play A0: you get 2 if opponent plays A0, 0 if opponent plays A1.\n- If you play A1: you get 3 if opponent plays A0, 1 if opponent plays A1.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs are symmetric but not identical \u2014 note that when you get 0, they get 3, and vice versa. So it\u2019s a zero-sum component with a cooperative component.\n\nActually, let\u2019s check if it\u2019s zero-sum:\n- (2,2): sum=4\n- (0,3): sum=3\n- (3,0): sum=3\n- (1,1): sum=2\n\nNot zero-sum. So it\u2019s a general-sum game.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium (mixed strategy)\n\nWe want to find a mixed strategy for ourselves that makes the opponent indifferent between A0 and A1 \u2014 because if they are indifferent, they have no incentive to deviate, and we can assume rational play.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the opponent plays A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1-p).\n\nThen your expected payoff for playing A0:\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nYour expected payoff for playing A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nNow, for you to be indifferent between A0 and A1, set them equal:\n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 Impossible.\n\nWait \u2014 that means A1 always gives you 1 more point than A0, regardless of p.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nE[A0] = 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p  \nE[A1] = 3p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo E[A1] = E[A0] + 1\n\nThat means **A1 strictly dominates A0** for you!\n\nNo matter what the opponent does, playing A1 gives you 1 more point than playing A0.\n\n- If opponent plays A0: A1 gives 3 > 2 (A0)\n- If opponent plays A1: A1 gives 1 > 0 (A0)\n\nSo A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for you.\n\nTherefore, the rational choice is to always play A1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about the opponent? The opponent is also rational. Let\u2019s check if A1 is dominant for them too.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n- If you play A0: opponent gets 2 (if they play A0) or 3 (if they play A1) \u2192 so A1 > A0\n- If you play A1: opponent gets 0 (if they play A0) or 1 (if they play A1) \u2192 so A1 > A0\n\nSo for the opponent too, A1 strictly dominates A0.\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoff (1,1).\n\nEven though (A0,A0) gives higher joint payoff (2,2), it\u2019s not stable because each player has an incentive to deviate to A1 for a higher individual payoff.\n\n### Step 3: Consider reputation\n\nThe note says:  \n> Your chosen action will affect your reputation score.  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/5 rounds (0.00%)  \n> openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT) played A0 in 0/5 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis suggests that so far, *no one* has played A0. That reinforces that A1 is the dominant and expected choice.\n\nIf we play A0 now, we get 0 if opponent plays A1 (which they almost certainly will), and we get 2 only if they play A0 \u2014 but they have no incentive to do so.\n\nSo playing A0 is extremely risky and irrational.\n\n### Step 4: Final decision\n\nSince A1 is strictly dominant for both players, and the opponent is likely to play A1 (as history shows), the optimal strategy is to play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nWe must output a probability distribution as integers summing to 100.\n\nSo:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nThis maximizes our expected payoff given rational opponents and dominant strategy.\n\nFinal Answer:"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|                   | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0            | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1            | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (as integers between 0 and 100 summing to 100).\n\nThis game is similar to the \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" but with a different payoff structure. Note that:\n- If both choose A0, both get 2 (which is better than mutual A1 giving 1).\n- However, if you choose A1 and opponent chooses A0, you get 3 (temptation to defect).\n- If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A1, you get 0 (sucker's payoff).\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium in pure strategies is (A1, A1) because:\n- Given opponent chooses A1, your best response is A1 (1 > 0).\n- Given opponent chooses A0, your best response is A1 (3 > 2).\nSo A1 is a dominant strategy. Thus, both players choosing A1 is the Nash Equilibrium.\n\nHowever, we are to choose a mixed strategy. Let's compute the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.\n\nSuppose you choose A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1-p).\nOpponent chooses A0 with probability q, and A1 with probability (1-q).\n\nYour expected payoff is:\nE(you) = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n       = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n       = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n       = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n       = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSimilarly, the opponent's expected payoff (symmetrical) is:\nE(opp) = 2p + 1 - q\n\nIn mixed strategy Nash, each player should be indifferent between their actions.\n\nSo for you to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\nPayoff from A0 = q*2 + (1-q)*0 = 2q\nPayoff from A1 = q*3 + (1-q)*1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\nSet equal: 2q = 2q + 1  => 0=1, which is impossible.\n\nThis means there is no mixed strategy where you are indifferent; you always strictly prefer A1 over A0 because 2q+1 > 2q for all q. Therefore, the only Nash is pure strategy A1.\n\nSo the best response is to always choose A1.\n\nNow, considering reputation: \n- Both players have chosen A0 0% in the past (so they always chose A1). This reinforces that the opponent is likely to choose A1.\n\nTherefore, to maximize my score, I should choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nFinal distribution:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1. Let:\n- p = probability that we choose A0 (so 1-p is probability for A1)\n- q = probability that opponent chooses A0 (so 1-q is for A1)\n\nOur expected payoff (U) is:\nU = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSimilarly, the opponent's expected payoff (V) is:\nV = q * [p*2 + (1-p)*0] + (1-q) * [p*3 + (1-p)*1]\n  = q * [2p] + (1-q) * [3p + 1 - p]\n  = 2pq + (1-q)(2p + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2p + 1 - 2pq - q\n  = 2p + 1 - q\n\nWe are trying to maximize our own payoff. However, the opponent is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.\n\nThis is a classic \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" type game. There are two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A1) and (A1, A0) with payoffs (3,0) and (0,3) respectively, and one mixed Nash equilibrium.\n\nTo find the mixed Nash equilibrium, we set the opponent's strategy such that we are indifferent between our actions.\n\nSet the payoff for us playing A0 equal to playing A1 given the opponent's mixed strategy q:\n\nPayoff from A0: 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\nPayoff from A1: 3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nFor indifference: 2q = 2q + 1? This is impossible. Actually, wait, let me recalculate properly.\n\nActually, for a mixed strategy to be optimal, the opponent should choose q such that we are indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nSo set:\nExpected value of A0 = Expected value of A1\n2q = 3q + 1*(1-q)\n2q = 3q + 1 - q\n2q = 2q + 1\n0 = 1\n\nThis is a contradiction. This means there is no mixed strategy that makes us indifferent? Actually, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: for us to be willing to mix, the payoffs must be equal. But here, the payoff for A1 is always higher than for A0 by 1 (since 2q+1 vs 2q). So we always prefer A1 regardless of q? But that would mean we should always play A1.\n\nBut if we always play A1, then the opponent should play A0 to get 0? Actually, if we always play A1, opponent's best response is to play A0 (to get 0) rather than A1 (to get 1)? Wait: if we play A1, opponent gets 0 if they play A0, and 1 if they play A1. So they prefer A1.\n\nSo if we always play A1, opponent should play A1 to get 1 (which is better than 0). Then we get 1.\n\nBut if opponent always plays A1, we get 1 from A1 and 0 from A0, so we stick with A1.\n\nSimilarly, if opponent always plays A0, we get 3 from A1 and 2 from A0, so we prefer A1.\n\nSo indeed, for us, A1 always gives at least as good as A0 and sometimes better. Specifically:\n- If opponent plays A0: A1 gives 3 > 2\n- If opponent plays A1: A1 gives 1 > 0\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0. Therefore, we should always choose A1.\n\nSimilarly, by symmetry, the opponent should always choose A1.\n\nSo the only rational outcome is (A1, A1) with payoff (1,1).\n\nBut wait, is there a way to get a better outcome? If we both play A0 we get (2,2) which is better. But how to coordinate? Since we cannot communicate, and the game is one-shot, we cannot trust the opponent to play A0.\n\nGiven the reputation: both players have played A0 0% in the past 5 rounds. So both have always played A1. So the opponent is likely to play A1 again.\n\nTherefore, we should play A1 to avoid getting 0.\n\nSo the best is to assign probability 0 to A0 and 100 to A1.\n\nThus, the distribution is {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (i.e., how often to play A0 and A1) in the form of percentages that sum to 100.\n\nThis game resembles the \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" but with slightly different payoffs.

Since A1 is dominant, we should play A1 with 100% probability. But note the reputation: it says that in the past 5 rounds, we played A0 0% of the time (so we always played A1).

We need to think about what the opponent might do. Since the game is symmetric, we can look for a Nash equilibrium where both players use the same strategy.\n\nSuppose both players use the same mixed strategy: probability p for A0 and (1-p) for A1.\n\nThen the expected payoff for a player when they choose A0 is:\nE(A0) = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n\nThe expected payoff for choosing A1 is:\nE(A1) = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nFor a mixed strategy to be an equilibrium, the player should be indifferent between A0 and A1. So set E(A0) = E(A1):\n2p = 2p + 1\n=> 0 = 1, which is impossible.\n\nThis contradiction means there is no symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium where both players use the same p. Actually, this game is similar to the \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game. The pure strategy equilibria are (A0, A1) and (A1, A0). There is also a mixed strategy equilibrium.\n\nTo find the mixed strategy equilibrium, we need to find p such that the opponent is indifferent between their actions.\n\nFor the opponent, their expected payoff if they choose A0 is:\nE_opp(A0) = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p   [because we are playing A0 with prob p, A1 with (1-p)]\n\nIf they choose A1:\nE_opp(A1) = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nFor the opponent to be indifferent, set E_opp(A0) = E_opp(A1):\n2p = 2p + 1\nAgain, 0=1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, this suggests that there is no mixed strategy that makes the opponent indifferent. Actually, note that E_opp(A1) is always 1 higher than E_opp(A0). So the opponent always strictly prefers A1 over A0, regardless of our strategy. Therefore, the opponent will always choose A1 with probability 1.\n\nSimilarly, from our perspective, if we assume the opponent will always choose A1 (since it dominates? Let's check: for the opponent, comparing A0 and A1:\n- If we play A0, they get 2 vs 3 (so A1 is better)\n- If we play A1, they get 0 vs 1 (so A1 is better)\nSo indeed, A1 strictly dominates A0 for the opponent. Therefore, the opponent will always choose A1.\n\nKnowing that the opponent will always choose A1 (q=0), our expected payoff becomes:\nE = 1 - p + 2*0 = 1 - p\n\nTo maximize this, we should minimize p. So we should choose p=0 (always A1).\n\nThen we get payoff 1, and opponent gets 1.\n\nIf we choose A0 when opponent chooses A1, we get 0, which is worse.\n\nTherefore, the best response is to always choose A1.\n\nNow, looking at the reputation:\n- We have played A0 in 0/5 rounds (0%), and opponent similarly.\nThis is consistent with the equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, we should choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nSo the probability distribution is: A0:0, A1:100.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

That suggests I always prefer A1, regardless of p.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nIf I play A0: payoff = 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p  \nIf I play A1: payoff = 3p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo:  \nE[A1] = 2p + 1  \nE[A0] = 2p  \n\nSo E[A1] = E[A0] + 1 \u2192 A1 always gives 1 more point than A0, regardless of p.\n\nThat means **A1 strictly dominates A0** for me!\n\nBecause for any probability the opponent chooses, playing A1 gives me 1 more point than playing A0.\n\nLet\u2019s verify with extreme cases:\n\n- If opponent plays A0 with 100%:  \n  A0 \u2192 2, A1 \u2192 3 \u2192 A1 better  \n- If opponent plays A1 with 100%:  \n  A0 \u2192 0, A1 \u2192 1 \u2192 A1 better\n\nSo in all cases, A1 gives strictly higher payoff.\n\nTherefore, **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy**.\n\n### Step 3: Optimal strategy\n\nSince A1 strictly dominates A0, the rational choice is to play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nEven if the opponent is playing randomly or irrationally, A1 is always better.\n\n### Step 4: Reputation note\n\nThe reputation shows that both I and the opponent have played A0 in 0/5 rounds \u2014 meaning so far, we\u2019ve both been playing A1. That\u2019s consistent with this dominant strategy.\n\nSo I should continue playing A1 with 100% probability.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}]]

But let\u2019s double-check the algebra.\n\nLet me recompute carefully:\n\nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1  \n= 2pq + 0 + 3q(1-p) + 1*(1-p)(1-q)  \n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + (1 - p - q + pq)  \n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q - p - q + 1  \n= (0) + (3q - q) - p + 1  \n= 2q - p + 1\n\nYes, correct:  \n**Your expected payoff = 1 - p + 2q**\n\nBut this is strange \u2014 it implies your payoff depends **only** on your own p and opponent\u2019s q linearly, with no cross terms. That suggests that **your best response depends entirely on what q is**.\n\nLet\u2019s find your **best response** to a given q.\n\nYour expected payoff: E = 1 - p + 2q\n\nSince p is your choice (0 \u2264 p \u2264 1), and 2q is fixed from opponent\u2019s side:\n\n- If we fix q, then E = (1 + 2q) - p \u2192 to **maximize E**, we want to **minimize p** \u2192 set p = 0\n\nWait \u2014 that suggests **always play A1** (p=0) regardless of q?\n\nBut let\u2019s test with actual values.\n\nSuppose opponent plays A0 with probability q = 1 (always A0):\n\n- Your payoff if you play A0: 2\n- Your payoff if you play A1: 3 \u2192 so better to play A1 \u2192 p=0\n\nSuppose opponent plays A1 with probability 1 (q=0):\n\n- Your payoff if you play A0: 0\n- Your payoff if you play A1: 1 \u2192 better to play A1 \u2192 p=0\n\nSuppose opponent plays A0 with 50% (q=0.5):\n\n- If you play A0: 0.5*2 + 0.5*0 = 1\n- If you play A1: 0.5*3 + 0.5*1 = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 still better to play A1\n\nSo **no matter what the opponent does**, playing A1 gives you **at least 1**, and playing A0 gives you **at most 2**, but only if opponent plays A0 \u2014 and even then, A1 gives 3 if opponent plays A0.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the **minimum** payoff for each of your pure strategies:\n\n- If you play A0: your payoff is 2 if opponent plays A0, 0 if opponent plays A1 \u2192 min = 0\n- If you play A1: your payoff is 3 if opponent plays A0, 1 if opponent plays A1 \u2192 min = 1\n\nSo A1 dominates A0: **A1 is strictly dominant**.\n\nBecause:\n- When opponent plays A0: A1 (3) > A0 (2)\n- When opponent plays A1: A1 (1) > A0 (0)\n\n\u2705 So **A1 strictly dominates A0**.\n\nTherefore, **no matter what the opponent does, you are always better off playing A1**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: What about the opponent?\n\nThe opponent has the same payoff matrix from their perspective? Let\u2019s check.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                        | 2        | 3        |\n| **A1**                        | 0        | 1        |\n\nSo for opponent:\n- If they play A0: get 2 if you play A0, 0 if you play A1 \u2192 min 0\n- If they play A1: get 3 if you play A0, 1 if you play A1 \u2192 min 1\n\nSo for opponent: A1 also dominates A0.\n\nBecause:\n- If you play A0 \u2192 opponent gets 3 (A1) > 2 (A0)\n- If you play A1 \u2192 opponent gets 1 (A1) > 0 (A0)\n\n\u2705 So **A1 is strictly dominant for both players**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Equilibrium\n\nThe unique Nash equilibrium is **both players play A1 with probability 1**.\n\nIn that case:\n- You get 1 point\n- Opponent gets 1 point\n\nIs there a better outcome? Yes \u2014 if both played A0, you\u2019d both get 2. But that\u2019s not stable, because each has incentive to deviate to A1 to get 3.\n\nSo rational players will both play A1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Reputation Note\n\n> Reputation: qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/10 rounds (0.00%)  \n> openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT) played A0 in 0/10 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis suggests that **both players have been playing A1 so far**. That\u2019s consistent with the dominant strategy.\n\nThere\u2019s no incentive to deviate. Even if you try to \u201ccooperate\u201d by playing A0, you risk getting 0 if opponent plays A1 (which they will, because it\u2019s dominant).\n\nSo **stick with A1**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Output Format\n\nWe must output a probability distribution as integers from 0 to 100, summing to 100.\n\nSince A1 is strictly dominant, we choose:\n\n- A0: 0%\n- A1: 100%\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|                   | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0            | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1            | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (as integers between 0 and 100 summing to 100).\n\nFirst, note that this is similar to a \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" type game, but with slightly different payoffs. In Prisoner's Dilemma, the dominant strategy is to defect (here, A1), but let's check:\n\n- If opponent plays A0: you get 2 for A0, 3 for A1 -> better to play A1.\n- If opponent plays A1: you get 0 for A0, 1 for A1 -> better to play A1.\n\nSo A1 is a dominant strategy: no matter what the opponent does, you get a higher payoff by playing A1. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nHowever, we are to choose a probability distribution. Since A1 is dominant, we might want to play A1 with 100% probability. But let's consider the reputation: the reputation shows that both players have played A0 0% in the last 10 rounds. This means both have been playing A1 always. So if both always play A1, we get (1,1) which is not the best joint outcome (which would be (2,2) if both play A0).\n\nBut since we are to maximize our own score, and given that the opponent is also rational (and from reputation, they always play A1), we should play A1 to avoid getting 0 (if we play A0 and they play A1). So indeed, playing A1 is safe.\n\nHowever, we are to output a probability distribution. Since the dominant strategy is pure (A1), we should assign 100% to A1.\n\nBut wait: the instruction says \"Your chosen action will affect your reputation score\". Reputation might be used by the opponent to decide their strategy. However, in this case, the reputation shows that both have been playing A1 always. So there is no incentive to deviate.\n\nMoreover, the opponent is also a rational agent (qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)) and they have also played A0 0% (so always A1). So they are likely to play A1 again.\n\nTherefore, we should play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nFinal distribution: {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **me** (the row player) is:\n\n- If I choose A0 and opponent chooses A0 \u2192 I get 2\n- If I choose A0 and opponent chooses A1 \u2192 I get 0\n- If I choose A1 and opponent chooses A0 \u2192 I get 3\n- If I choose A1 and opponent chooses A1 \u2192 I get 1\n\nThis is a symmetric game in structure, but not symmetric in payoffs (since payoffs are not mirrored \u2014 e.g., when I get 3, opponent gets 0, and vice versa). So it's a **non-zero-sum, asymmetric** game.\n\nLet me denote:\n- My probability of playing A0 as `p` \u2192 so A1 is `1-p`\n- Opponent\u2019s probability of playing A0 as `q` \u2192 so A1 is `1-q`\n\nI want to choose `p` to maximize my **expected payoff**, but I don't know `q`.

The reputation note says:\n\n> \"deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT) played A0 in 0/10 rounds (0.00%)  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/10 rounds (0.00%)\"\n\nThis suggests this is part of a **repeated game** over 10 rounds, and reputation is tracked.\n\nBut crucially, we are told to choose a probability distribution **each round**, and the opponent's past behavior (0% A0) suggests they consistently play A1.\n\nSo if the opponent has played A1 in all 10 rounds so far, and we assume they continue to play A1 (because it's dominant), then my best response is to play A1 as well to get 1 point instead of 0.\n\nBut here's another angle: could we try to exploit a potential mistake?\n\nSuppose the opponent might sometimes play A0 (even though it\u2019s dominated). Then my expected payoff from playing A0 is:\n\nE[A0] = q * 2 + (1 - q) * 0 = 2q\n\nE[A1] = q * 3 + (1 - q) * 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSo E[A1] = E[A0] + 1 \u2192 A1 is always 1 point better than A0, regardless of q.\n\nThus, **A1 strictly dominates A0 for me as well**.\n\nWait \u2014 let me verify:\n\nCompare my two strategies:\n\nFor any q \u2208 [0,1]:\n\nE[A1] - E[A0] = [3q + 1(1-q)] - [2q + 0(1-q)]  \n= (3q + 1 - q) - (2q)  \n= (2q + 1) - 2q  \n= 1 > 0\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0 for me too**.\n\nTherefore, no matter what the opponent does, I always get 1 more point by playing A1 than A0.\n\nSo my optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nGiven the format requires integer probabilities summing to 100, I should output:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nAlso, note that our reputation already shows 0/10 A0, so we are already aligned with this strategy.\n\nNo incentive to deviate.\n\nFinal decision: play A1 with 100% probability.\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **you** is:\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                        | 2        | 0        |\n| **A1**                        | 3        | 1        |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1, expressed as integers from 0 to 100 that sum to 100.\n\nThis is a **non-zero-sum game**, and we want to maximize our **expected payoff**, assuming the opponent is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.\n\nBut note: we don\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s strategy.

So there is no mixed strategy where we are indifferent. Actually, E(A1) is always greater than E(A0) by 1, regardless of q. So we always prefer A1.\n\nSimilarly, for the opponent to be indifferent:\nOpponent's payoff if they choose A0: E_opp(A0) = 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p\nOpponent's payoff if they choose A1: E_opp(A1) = 3p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nAgain, E_opp(A1) is always greater than E_opp(A0) by 1.

This is consistent with always playing A1.\n\nTherefore, we should set probability for A1 to 100%.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, 2-action simultaneous game with the following payoffs for **you** (the row player):\n\n| You \\ Opponent | A0       | A1       |\n|----------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**         | 2        | 0        |\n| **A1**         | 3        | 1        |\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs are symmetric but not identical:\n- When you get 2, opponent gets 2\n- When you get 0, opponent gets 3\n- When you get 3, opponent gets 0\n- When you get 1, opponent gets 1\n\nSo the game is **not symmetric** in payoffs \u2014 it\u2019s a **asymmetric coordination/competition** game.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Game as a Strategic Interaction\n\nThis resembles a **Battle of the Sexes** or **Chicken-like** game, but with asymmetric payoffs.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- Your strategy: choose A0 with probability `p`, A1 with probability `1-p`\n- Opponent\u2019s strategy: choose A0 with probability `q`, A1 with probability `1-q`\n\nWe want to **maximize your expected payoff**, but we don\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s strategy. However, we are told the **reputation** of the opponent:\n\n> openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT) played A0 in 0/10 rounds (0.00%)  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/10 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis is **our own reputation** \u2014 we have played A0 in 0 out of 10 rounds \u2192 we have **always played A1** so far.\n\nThis suggests that **the opponent (likely another AI)** has also **never played A0** \u2014 they\u2019ve always played A1.\n\nSo, based on observed behavior, the opponent is **playing A1 with 100% probability**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Best Response to Opponent\u2019s Observed Behavior\n\nIf the opponent is playing **A1 with probability 1**, then:\n\n- If we play A0 \u2192 we get 0\n- If we play A1 \u2192 we get 1\n\nSo **A1 gives us a higher payoff (1 > 0)**.\n\nTherefore, **best response** to an opponent who always plays A1 is to play **A1**.\n\nBut \u2014 we must consider: is this a one-shot game or repeated?\n\nThe context says \u201ceach round\u201d, and reputation is tracked over 10 rounds. So this is a **repeated game**.\n\nWe are currently at round 10? Or are we in the middle? The reputation says \u201c0/10\u201d, so likely we are at the **end of 10 rounds**, and this is the **final round**?

In the classic Prisoner's Dilemma, the payoff for mutual defection is worse than mutual cooperation, but here mutual defection (A1,A1) gives (1,1) which is better than the (0,3) or (3,0) outcomes. However, mutual cooperation (A0,A0) gives (2,2) which is better than mutual defection (1,1).\n\nBut there is a temptation to defect: if you choose A1 when opponent chooses A0, you get 3 (which is the highest payoff). Similarly, if you choose A0 when opponent chooses A1, you get 0 (the worst).\n\nNow, we are to choose a mixed strategy. Let p be the probability we choose A0, and (1-p) for A1. Similarly, let q be the probability the opponent chooses A0, and (1-q) for A1.\n\nOur expected payoff is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait, let me recalculate carefully:\n\nE = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p)*[3q + 1*(1-q)]\n  = p * (2q) + (1-p)*(3q + 1 - q)\n  = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = (2q - p) + 1\n\nSo E = 1 + 2q - p.\n\nThis means that our payoff increases with the opponent's probability of choosing A0 (q) and decreases with our own probability of choosing A0 (p). To maximize our payoff, we want p as small as possible (i.e., choose A1 with high probability) and hope that the opponent chooses A0 with high probability.\n\nBut note: the opponent is also rational and has the same incentives. The opponent's expected payoff is symmetric:\nE_opponent = 1 + 2p - q   [by symmetry]\n\nSo if both players try to minimize their own p (i.e., defect more), then both will set p low and q low, leading to mutual defection (A1,A1) with payoff (1,1).\n\nHowever, if both cooperate (choose A0), they get (2,2) which is better. So there is a tension.\n\nWhat is the Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies?\nSet the expected payoff from A0 equal to expected payoff from A1 for a player, assuming the other is playing mixed strategy.\n\nFor us, given opponent plays q (prob A0):\nPayoff from us playing A0: 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\nPayoff from us playing A1: 3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSo for any q, the payoff from A1 is always 1 more than from A0. Therefore, we always prefer A1 regardless of what the opponent does. Similarly, the opponent always prefers A1.\n\nSo the dominant strategy for both is to choose A1. The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nBut this is Pareto inferior to (A0,A0) which gives (2,2). However, without communication or repetition, the rational choice is to defect (choose A1).\n\nNow, in this specific game, we are playing against an opponent who is also a rational AI (openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)). According to the reputation, it has played A0 in 0/10 rounds (0%) in the past. So it always defects (chooses A1).\n\nTherefore, the opponent will choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nGiven that, what should we do?\nIf opponent chooses A1 with certainty (q=0), then:\n- If we choose A0: we get 0\n- If we choose A1: we get 1\n\nSo we should choose A1 to get 1 rather than 0.\n\nTherefore, we should also defect with probability 100%.\n\nSo our strategy: choose A1 with probability 100%, i.e., {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nThis maximizes our payoff given the opponent's behavior.\n\nEven without the reputation, since the dominant strategy is to choose A1, we should do that.\n\nThus, the answer is clear.\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}]]

It resembles a \"Chicken\" or \"Battle of the Sexes\" type game, but let\u2019s analyze it as a normal-form game to find the Nash equilibrium.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Payoff Matrix\n\nYour payoffs:\n- If you play A0: you get 2 if opponent plays A0, 0 if opponent plays A1.\n- If you play A1: you get 3 if opponent plays A0, 1 if opponent plays A1.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs are symmetric in a way, but not identical \u2014 it\u2019s asymmetric in the sense that when you get 0, they get 3, and vice versa. So it\u2019s a zero-sum component plus a coordination component.\n\nActually, let\u2019s check total payoffs:\n- (A0,A0): 4\n- (A0,A1): 3\n- (A1,A0): 3\n- (A1,A1): 2\n\nSo it\u2019s not zero-sum. It\u2019s a general-sum game.\n\n### Step 2: Find Best Responses\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the opponent plays A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1-p).\n\nThen your expected payoff for playing A0:\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nYour expected payoff for playing A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nCompare:\n- E[A0] = 2p\n- E[A1] = 2p + 1\n\nSo E[A1] is always 1 point higher than E[A0], regardless of p.\n\nThat means: **No matter what the opponent does, playing A1 gives you 1 more point than playing A0.**\n\nTherefore, A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for you.\n\n### Step 3: What about the opponent?\n\nLet\u2019s check from the opponent\u2019s perspective.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n- If they play A0: get 2 if you play A0, 0 if you play A1 \u2192 E = 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q (where q = prob you play A0)\n- If they play A1: get 3 if you play A0, 1 if you play A1 \u2192 E = 3q + 1*(1-q) = 2q + 1\n\nAgain: E[A1] = 2q + 1 > 2q = E[A0] \u2192 So A1 is also strictly dominant for the opponent.\n\n### Step 4: Nash Equilibrium\n\nSince A1 is strictly dominant for both players, the unique Nash equilibrium is both players playing A1 with probability 1.\n\nIn that case, both get 1 point.\n\nEven though (A0,A0) gives 2 each (better for both), it\u2019s not stable because each player has an incentive to deviate to A1 to get 3 if the other plays A0.\n\nBut since A1 is strictly dominant, no rational player would ever play A0.\n\n### Step 5: Reputation Context\n\nThe reputation note says:\n> openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT) played A0 in 0/15 rounds (0.00%)\n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/15 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis suggests that historically, this agent (and others) have been playing A1 100% of the time.\n\nThis reinforces that A1 is the expected and rational choice.\n\nThere is no benefit to deviating to A0 \u2014 it strictly dominates nothing, and gives lower expected payoff.\n\n### Step 6: Final Decision\n\nTo maximize your score, you should play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nThus, the optimal probability distribution is:\n- A0: 0%\n- A1: 100%\n\nThis is the only rational choice.\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "The payoff matrix for us is:\n\n|          | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|\n| **A0**   | 2           | 0           |\n| **A1**   | 3           | 1           |\n\n- If the opponent plays **A0**, we get 2 from A0 and 3 from A1 \u2192 **A1** is better.\n- If the opponent plays **A1**, we get 0 from A0 and 1 from A1 \u2192 **A1** is still better.\n\nThus **A1 strictly dominates A0**.

That means I am **never** indifferent.

I need to choose a mixed strategy (probability distribution over A0 and A1) that maximizes my expected payoff, assuming the opponent is also rational and likely playing optimally.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the game structure.\n\nThis resembles a \"Battle of the Sexes\" or \"Chicken\" game, but let\u2019s compute the Nash equilibria.\n\nLet me denote:\n- My probability of playing A0 as p, so A1 is 1-p.\n- Opponent\u2019s probability of playing A0 as q, so A1 is 1-q.\n\nMy expected payoff if I play A0:  \nE[A0] = q * 2 + (1 - q) * 0 = 2q\n\nMy expected payoff if I play A1:  \nE[A1] = q * 3 + (1 - q) * 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nNow, compare E[A0] and E[A1]:\nE[A1] - E[A0] = (2q + 1) - 2q = 1 > 0\n\nSo E[A1] is always 1 point higher than E[A0], regardless of q.\n\nThat means: **No matter what the opponent does, my expected payoff from A1 is strictly greater than from A0.**\n\nTherefore, **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy** for me.\n\nEven if the opponent plays A0 with 100% probability, I get 3 from A1 vs 2 from A0 \u2192 A1 better.  \nIf opponent plays A1 with 100% probability, I get 1 from A1 vs 0 from A0 \u2192 A1 better.\n\nSo A1 dominates A0.\n\nThus, the rational choice is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 let\u2019s check the opponent\u2019s perspective.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n- If opponent plays A0: gets 2 if I play A0, 0 if I play A1 \u2192 E = 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p\n- If opponent plays A1: gets 3 if I play A0, 1 if I play A1 \u2192 E = 3p + 1*(1-p) = 2p + 1\n\nSo again, for the opponent: E[A1] = 2p + 1 > E[A0] = 2p \u2192 So A1 is strictly dominant for opponent too.\n\nTherefore, (A1, A1) is the unique Nash equilibrium, and both players should play A1 with probability 1.\n\nIn this equilibrium, we both get 1 point.\n\nIs there any benefit to randomizing? No, because A1 is strictly dominant. Randomizing would only lower my expected payoff.\n\nFor example, if I play A0 with probability 0.1 and A1 with 0.9:\nMy expected payoff = 0.1 * 2q + 0.9 * (2q + 1) = 2q + 0.9\nBut if I play A1 with 100%: 2q + 1 \u2192 which is higher.\n\nSo best response is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nNow, looking at the reputation note:\n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/15 rounds (0.00%)\n> openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT) played A0 in 0/15 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis suggests that in the past 15 rounds, neither player has played A0. That supports the idea that A1 is being played consistently \u2014 likely because it's dominant.\n\nSo continuing to play A1 is consistent with both strategy and past behavior.\n\nI should play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nFinal answer: {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.

However, we can reason about what the opponent might do.\n\nThis game is similar to a \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game. The Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies can be found by making the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n\nFor the opponent to be indifferent between A0 and A1, their expected payoff from A0 should equal that from A1.\n\nIf opponent plays A0: they get 2 with probability p (when we play A0) and 0 with probability (1-p) (when we play A1). So E[V | A0] = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p.\nIf opponent plays A1: they get 3 with probability p (when we play A0) and 1 with probability (1-p) (when we play A1). So E[V | A1] = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1.\n\nSet them equal for indifference:\n2p = 2p + 1  => 0=1, which is impossible.\n\nThis indicates that there is no mixed strategy equilibrium where both are indifferent? Actually, wait, that can't be right. Let me check the payoffs again.\n\nActually, for the opponent:\nWhen they play A0: \n- If we play A0, they get 2.\n- If we play A1, they get 0.\nSo E[V | A0] = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p.\n\nWhen they play A1:\n- If we play A0, they get 3.\n- If we play A1, they get 1.\nSo E[V | A1] = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1.\n\nClearly, E[V | A1] = 2p+1 is always greater than E[V | A0] = 2p by exactly 1. So the opponent always prefers A1 regardless of what we do! Because 2p+1 > 2p for all p.\n\nSimilarly, from our perspective:\nIf we play A0: we get 2 with probability q (opponent A0) and 0 with probability (1-q) (opponent A1). So E[U | A0] = 2q.\nIf we play A1: we get 3 with probability q (opponent A0) and 1 with probability (1-q) (opponent A1). So E[U | A1] = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1.\n\nSo E[U | A1] = 2q+1 is always greater than E[U | A0] = 2q by exactly 1. Therefore, we always prefer A1 regardless of what the opponent does.\n\nThis means that both players have a strictly dominant strategy: always play A1. Because no matter what the other does, A1 gives a higher payoff.\n\nSpecifically:\n- If opponent plays A0: we get 3 with A1 vs 2 with A0.\n- If opponent plays A1: we get 1 with A1 vs 0 with A0.\n\nSo indeed, A1 is strictly better.\n\nTherefore, the only rational choice is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nNow, looking at the reputation:\n- Both players have played A0 0/15 times so far (0%). This is consistent with the dominant strategy.\n\nSo we should choose A1 with 100% probability.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

If opponent switches to A1, they get 3 \u2192 better \u2192 so not stable.\n- (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3. If I switch to A1, I get 1 \u2192 better for me. So I want to deviate \u2192 not stable.\n- (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0. Opponent wants to switch to A1 to get 1 \u2192 better \u2192 not stable.\n- (A1, A1): I get 1, opponent gets 1. If I switch to A0, I get 0 \u2192 worse. If opponent switches to A0, they get 0 \u2192 worse. So neither wants to deviate.\n\nWait \u2014 in (A1, A1), if I switch to A0, I get 0 (from 1), which is worse. Opponent switching to A0 gets 0 (from 1), also worse. So (A1, A1) is a Nash Equilibrium in pure strategies.\n\nBut also check (A0, A0): if I switch to A1, I get 3 > 2 \u2192 so I want to deviate \u2192 not NE.\n\n(A0, A1): I get 0, switching to A1 gives me 1 \u2192 I want to deviate.\n\n(A1, A0): opponent gets 0, switching to A1 gives 1 \u2192 they want to deviate.\n\nSo the only pure strategy Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoff (1,1).\n\nBut is that the best we can do? Maybe we can do better with mixed strategies.\n\n### Step 2: Find the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the opponent plays A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1-p).\n\nWe want to find our best response \u2014 i.e., the probability q we should play for A0 (and 1-q for A1) to maximize our expected payoff.\n\nOur expected payoff if we play A0:  \n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOur expected payoff if we play A1:  \n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nCompare:  \n- Payoff(A0) = 2p  \n- Payoff(A1) = 2p + 1\n\nSo Payoff(A1) is always 1 point higher than Payoff(A0), regardless of p.\n\nThat means: **No matter what the opponent does, playing A1 always gives us 1 more point than playing A0.**\n\nSo our dominant strategy is to always play A1.\n\nSimilarly, let\u2019s check from the opponent\u2019s perspective.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff if they play A0:  \n= q * 2 + (1-q) * 3 = 2q + 3 - 3q = 3 - q\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff if they play A1:  \n= q * 0 + (1-q) * 1 = 1 - q\n\nCompare:  \n- Payoff(A0) = 3 - q  \n- Payoff(A1) = 1 - q\n\nSo opponent\u2019s payoff from A0 is always 2 points higher than from A1, regardless of q.\n\nSo opponent\u2019s dominant strategy is to play A0.\n\nWait \u2014 this is a contradiction.\n\nFrom our perspective: A1 dominates A0 (always better by 1 point).\n\nFrom opponent\u2019s perspective: A0 dominates A1 (always better by 2 points).\n\nSo we have a conflict: each player has a dominant strategy, but they are incompatible.\n\nThis is a classic case of a game with two dominant strategies that conflict \u2014 leading to a unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies? But we saw earlier that (A1, A1) is a NE, but (A0, A0) is not.\n\nWait \u2014 let me recheck dominance.\n\n### Recheck dominance for us (player):\n\nIf opponent plays A0:  \n- We get 2 if we play A0  \n- We get 3 if we play A1 \u2192 A1 better\n\nIf opponent plays A1:  \n- We get 0 if we play A0  \n- We get 1 if we play A1 \u2192 A1 better\n\nSo yes, A1 strictly dominates A0 for us.\n\n### For opponent:\n\nIf we play A0:  \n- Opponent gets 2 if they play A0  \n- Opponent gets 3 if they play A1 \u2192 A1 better\n\nIf we play A1:  \n- Opponent gets 0 if they play A0  \n- Opponent gets 1 if they play A1 \u2192 A1 better\n\nWait! So for the opponent, A1 also strictly dominates A0!\n\nBecause:\n\n- When we play A0: opponent gets 3 from A1 > 2 from A0  \n- When we play A1: opponent gets 1 from A1 > 0 from A0\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0 for the opponent too.\n\nTherefore, **both players have a strictly dominant strategy: A1**\n\nThus, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoff (1,1) for both.\n\nThis is the only rational outcome.\n\n### Step 3: Reputation context\n\nThe reputation note says:\n\n> deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT) played A0 in 0/15 rounds (0.00%)  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/15 rounds (0.00%)\n\nSo both players have so far played A1 100% of the time.\n\nThis reinforces that A1 is the dominant strategy \u2014 and everyone is already playing it.\n\nThere is no incentive to deviate.\n\n### Step 4: Final decision\n\nWe should play A1 with probability 100%, because:\n\n- It is our strictly dominant strategy.\n- It is the opponent\u2019s strictly dominant strategy.\n- The equilibrium is (A1, A1).\n- Deviating to A0 would reduce our payoff by 1 point in every scenario.\n\nTherefore, we choose:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|                   | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0            | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1            | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (as integers between 0 and 100 that sum to 100).\n\nFirst, note that this is similar to a \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" type game but with slightly different payoffs.

Actually, note that 2p is always less than 2p+100, so the opponent always prefers A1 regardless of your strategy.\n\nTherefore, there is no mixed strategy equilibrium where both players mix. Actually, let's check pure strategies:\n\n- If you play A0, opponent best responds with A1 (gets 3 > 2).\n- If you play A1, opponent best responds with A1 (gets 1 > 0).\n\nSo regardless of what you do, the opponent prefers A1.

Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nHowever, we are asked to output a probability distribution. Since A1 is strictly dominant, we should choose A1 with probability 100% and A0 with 0%. But let's consider the reputation aspect.\n\nReputation note: \n   deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT) played A0 in 0/20 rounds (0.00%)\n   qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/20 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis means both players have always chosen A1 in the past. So the opponent is likely to choose A1 as well (since it is the dominant strategy and they have consistently done so). Therefore, if we both choose A1, we get 1 point each. If we deviate to A0 when they choose A1, we get 0 which is worse.\n\nBut is there any reason to randomize? Suppose we assign probability p to A0 and (1-p) to A1.\n\nOur expected payoff against the opponent (who we assume will choose A1 with probability 1 based on reputation) is:\n   p * 0 + (1-p)*1 = 1 - p.\n\nThis is maximized when p=0 (i.e., always A1). So no benefit to mixing.\n\nWhat if the opponent might change? But given the reputation, they are likely to stick to A1. Also, since A1 is strictly dominant, they have no incentive to change.\n\nTherefore, the best response is to choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nSo the distribution should be {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

No matter what the opponent does, I get a higher payoff by choosing A1.\n\n- Against A0: 3 > 2\n- Against A1: 1 > 0\n\nSo rational self-interest says: always play A1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 let\u2019s check the opponent\u2019s incentives.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n- If I play A0: opponent gets 2 (A0) or 3 (A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n- If I play A1: opponent gets 0 (A0) or 1 (A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n\nSo **A1 is also strictly dominant for the opponent**.\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), yielding (1,1).\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist: **reputation matters**.\n\nWe are told:\n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/20 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThat means, so far, we have never played A0. The system is tracking our behavior.\n\nAlso: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT) played A0 in 0/20 rounds \u2014 so both players are currently playing A1 100% of the time.\n\nIf we continue playing A1 100%, we get 1 point per round.\n\nBut what if we try to exploit?\n\nSuppose we play A0 with some probability p, and A1 with 1-p.\n\nIf the opponent continues playing A1 with 100% probability (as their history suggests), then:\n\n- If we play A0: we get 0\n- If we play A1: we get 1\n\nSo our expected payoff = p*0 + (1-p)*1 = 1 - p\n\nThis is maximized when p=0 \u2192 we get 1.\n\nSo even if we try to randomize, if opponent sticks to A1, we are best off playing A1 100%.\n\nBut what if the opponent is also thinking strategically?\n\nSuppose the opponent believes we might start playing A0 to \u201ctrick\u201d them, and they might switch to A0 to try to get 2 instead of 1.\n\nBut if opponent plays A0, and we play A1, we get 3 \u2014 which is better than 1.\n\nSo if opponent deviates to A0, we benefit by playing A1.\n\nBut if we play A0, and opponent plays A0, we get 2 \u2014 better than 1.\n\nSo there\u2019s a potential for mutual cooperation at (A0,A0) giving (2,2), which is better than (1,1).\n\nBut (A0,A0) is not a Nash equilibrium, because each player has incentive to deviate to A1 (3 > 2).\n\nSo why would anyone play A0?\n\nOnly if they expect the opponent to play A0, and they want to coordinate on the higher payoff.\n\nBut since A1 is strictly dominant, the only stable outcome is (A1,A1).\n\nHowever, the reputation system is tracking our behavior. So far, we\u2019ve played A0 0/20 times.\n\nThe instruction says: \u201cYour chosen action will affect your reputation score.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t say how reputation affects scoring, but it implies that reputation is a separate metric that might matter in future rounds or in evaluation.\n\nBut the objective is: **maximize your score**.\n\nSo we should focus on payoff, not reputation \u2014 unless reputation affects future payoffs.\n\nWe are not told that reputation affects future payoffs. We are only told it\u2019s tracked.\n\nSo we must assume that **only the current payoff matters**.\n\nTherefore, the rational choice is to play the strictly dominant strategy: A1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if the opponent is also using the same logic? Then we both play A1, get 1 each.\n\nIs there a way to get 2?\n\nOnly if we both play A0.\n\nBut to get both to play A0, we\u2019d need coordination \u2014 and since we move simultaneously and have no communication, and A1 is dominant, we can\u2019t rely on the opponent to play A0.\n\nIn fact, if we play A0 with any probability >0, and opponent plays A1 (which they are likely to, since it\u2019s dominant), we get 0 \u2014 worse than 1.\n\nSo the expected value of playing A0 with probability p is:\n\nE[payoff] = p * [opponent A0 * 2 + opponent A1 * 0] + (1-p) * [opponent A0 * 3 + opponent A1 * 1]\n\nBut we don\u2019t know opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\nWe only know their history: they played A0 in 0/20 rounds \u2192 so they have played A1 100% of the time.\n\nAssuming they continue this behavior (which is rational for them too), then opponent plays A1 with probability 1.\n\nThen:\n\nE[payoff] = p * 0 + (1-p) * 1 = 1 - p\n\nTo maximize this, set p = 0 \u2192 play A1 with 100%.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nThis gives us 1 point per round, which is the best we can get given the opponent\u2019s behavior.\n\nEven if we try to \u201ccooperate\u201d by playing A0 sometimes, we risk getting 0, and the gain from mutual A0 (2) is only possible if opponent also cooperates \u2014 which they have no incentive to do.\n\nTherefore, the best response is to stick with A1.\n\nFinal decision: play A1 with 100% probability.\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (as integers between 0 and 100 summing to 100).\n\nThis is similar to a \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game.

We must choose a **probability distribution** over A0 and A1 (i.e., a mixed strategy), and the opponent does the same.\n\nOur goal: **Maximize our expected payoff**, given that the opponent is also rational and likely doing the same.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Opponent\u2019s Behavior\n\nWe are told the opponent (openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)) has played A0 in **0/20 rounds** \u2014 meaning they have **always played A1** in the past.\n\nThis is critical.\n\nEven though we don\u2019t know their future strategy, **past behavior is strong evidence** of their strategy \u2014 especially in repeated games where players adapt.\n\nSo, **we can reasonably assume the opponent is playing A1 with probability close to 100%**.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the opponent plays:\n\n- A0: 0%\n- A1: 100%\n\nThis is supported by the data: 0/20 A0 choices.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute Expected Payoff for Our Strategies\n\nWe need to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (p for A0, 1-p for A1).\n\nLet\u2019s compute our expected payoff **if opponent plays A1 with 100% probability**.\n\n- If we play **A0**: we get 0 points (from matrix)\n- If we play **A1**: we get 1 point (from matrix)\n\nSo, if opponent always plays A1:\n\n- Expected payoff for A0: 0\n- Expected payoff for A1: 1\n\n\u2192 **We are strictly better off playing A1**.\n\nSo, **best response to opponent playing A1 always is to play A1 with 100% probability**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Consider if Opponent Might Change\n\nCould the opponent switch to A0?\n\nPossibly \u2014 but we have **no evidence** they will. In fact, they\u2019ve played A1 20 times in a row. That\u2019s strong evidence of a **dominant or learned strategy**.\n\nMoreover, if the opponent were to switch to A0, they would get 0 points (if we play A1) \u2014 which is worse than 1 point (if they play A1 and we play A1). So **A1 is better for them too** if we play A1.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s check if A1 is a dominant strategy for the opponent.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                        | 2        | 3        |\n| **A1**                        | 0        | 1        |\n\nSo for opponent:\n\n- If we play A0 \u2192 opponent gets 3 by playing A1, 2 by playing A0 \u2192 prefers A1\n- If we play A1 \u2192 opponent gets 1 by playing A1, 0 by playing A0 \u2192 prefers A1\n\n\u2192 **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for the opponent**.\n\nSo regardless of what we do, **the opponent\u2019s best response is always A1**.\n\nTherefore, **we can be 100% confident the opponent will play A1**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Our Best Response\n\nGiven opponent plays A1 with probability 1:\n\n- If we play A0 \u2192 we get 0\n- If we play A1 \u2192 we get 1\n\n\u2192 So we should play **A1 with 100% probability** to maximize our payoff.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Reputation Consideration\n\nWe are told:\n\n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/20 rounds (0.00%)\n\nSo we have **already been playing A1** in all 20 rounds.\n\nThis suggests we are already aligned with the optimal strategy.\n\nContinuing to play A1 maintains consistency and maximizes payoff.\n\nNo reason to deviate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWe should play **A1 with 100% probability**, A0 with 0%.\n\nThis maximizes our expected payoff given the opponent\u2019s dominant strategy and historical behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Output in Required Format\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix\n\nWe have two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **you** (the player) is:\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                        | 2 points | 0 points |\n| **A1**                        | 3 points | 1 point  |\n\nThis is a **2-player, simultaneous-move game** with **no communication**.

This is impossible unless we consider that actually the opponent's payoffs are symmetric to yours.\n\nWait, actually from the opponent's perspective:\nWhen they choose A0:\n- If you choose A0: they get 2\n- If you choose A1: they get 0\nSo E_opp(A0) = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n\nWhen they choose A1:\n- If you choose A0: they get 3\n- If you choose A1: they get 1\nSo E_opp(A1) = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet equal for indifference: 2p = 2p + 1 -> which is never true. So there is no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium? Actually, that means one strategy always dominates.\n\nCompare E_opp(A0)=2p and E_opp(A1)=2p+1. Since 2p+1 > 2p for all p, the opponent always prefers A1 regardless of what you do. Similarly, from your perspective, your payoff for A1 is always better than A0?\n\nCheck your own actions:\nIf you choose A0: expected payoff = q*2 + (1-q)*0 = 2q\nIf you choose A1: expected payoff = q*3 + (1-q)*1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSo indeed, 2q+1 > 2q for all q. Therefore, A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players.\n\nSo the only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\nBut wait, why is there (A0,A0) giving (2,2) which is better? However, it is not stable because each player has an incentive to deviate: if you expect the opponent to play A0, you can get 3 by playing A1 instead of 2. Similarly, the opponent thinks the same.\n\nSo (A0,A0) is Pareto efficient but not Nash. (A1,A1) is the only Nash equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, both players should choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nNow, looking at the reputation:\n- Both players have played A0 0% in the past 20 rounds. This suggests that both have been playing A1 always.\n\nSo to maximize your score, you should continue to play A1 with certainty.\n\nThus, the probability distribution should be {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (i.e., probabilities p for A0 and (1-p) for A1).\n\nThis game is similar to the \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game.

So we should choose A1 with probability 1.\n\nBut wait, the reputation says that we have played A0 in 0/20 rounds (0%), meaning we always played A1. This is consistent with the above.\n\nHowever, if both always choose A1, the outcome is (1,1), which is a Nash equilibrium. But is it the only one? Actually, (A0, A1) is also a Nash: if opponent plays A1, we get 0 from A0 and 1 from A1, so we prefer A1. Similarly, if we play A1, opponent gets 1 from A1 and 0 from A0, so they prefer A1. So (A1,A1) is symmetric Nash.\n\nSimilarly, (A0,A0) is not Nash: if both play A0, we get 2, but if we deviate to A1 we get 3, so we want to deviate.\n\nSo the only symmetric Nash equilibrium is both playing A1.\n\nTherefore, we should always play A1.\n\nBut the reputation shows we have always played A1 in the past (0% A0), which is correct.\n\nSo for this round, we should continue to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nThus, the probability distribution is: A0:0, A1:100.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}]]

Since the game is symmetric and we don't have a specific history (reputation shows both players have never played A0 in the last 25 rounds), we should look for a Nash equilibrium.\n\nLet:\n- p = probability that we choose A0\n- q = probability that opponent chooses A0\n\nOur expected payoff (U) is:\nU = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - p(2q + 1)\n\nTo find our best response, we differentiate with respect to p:\ndU/dp = 2q - (2q + 1) = -1\n\nThis derivative is constant and negative (-1), meaning that our expected payoff decreases as p increases. Therefore, we should set p as low as possible to maximize our payoff. That is, we should always choose A1 (p=0).\n\nBut wait, let's check if this is indeed a Nash equilibrium. If we always choose A1 (p=0), then the opponent's expected payoff when they choose:\n- A0: gets 0 (from the payoff matrix: when opponent chooses A0 and we choose A1, opponent gets 0)\n- A1: gets 1 (when both choose A1)\n\nSo the opponent's best response is to always choose A1 (since 1 > 0). Similarly, if the opponent always chooses A1, our expected payoff for:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 1\nSo we should choose A1. Therefore, (A1, A1) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nHowever, is there a mixed strategy equilibrium? Suppose the opponent uses a mixed strategy q. Our expected payoff is:\nU = 2pq + (1-p)(2q+1) = 2pq + 2q + 1 - p(2q+1)\n\nAs derived, dU/dp = -1 < 0, so we always prefer to decrease p. Therefore, the only equilibrium is for both to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nBut note the reputation: both players have played A0 0 times in the last 25 rounds, meaning they always played A1. This is consistent with the equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, to maximize our score, we should always choose A1.

Then opponent is indifferent. Suppose opponent plays q=0.5.\n\nThen my payoff: E = 1 - 2/3 + 2*(0.5) = 1/3 + 1 = 4/3 \u2248 1.33\n\nBut if I deviate to p=0: E = 1 - 0 + 2*0.5 = 2 \u2192 better! So p=2/3 is not a best response unless opponent plays q=1, but if opponent plays q=1, then p=0 is better than p=2/3.\n\nSo the only pure Nash equilibrium is (A1, A0) \u2192 I play A1, opponent plays A0.\n\nBut what about mixed strategy equilibria?\n\nSuppose we look for a mixed strategy where I am indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nI am indifferent if:  \nExpected payoff from A0 = Expected payoff from A1  \n2q = 2q + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nWait \u2014 earlier we had:\n\nIf I play A0: payoff = 2q  \nIf I play A1: payoff = 2q + 1\n\nSo A1 always gives 1 more than A0, for any q.\n\nTherefore, **I always prefer A1**, no matter what the opponent does.\n\nSimilarly, opponent\u2019s best response depends on p.\n\nBut since I always prefer A1, I will set p = 0 (i.e., 100% A1).\n\nThen opponent, seeing that I play A1 with 100% probability (p=1? Wait \u2014 p is prob I play A0, so p=0 means I play A1 with 100%).\n\nSo opponent sees p=0 \u2192 then opponent\u2019s payoff from A0: 3 - p = 3  \nFrom A1: 2p + 1 = 1  \nSo opponent prefers A0 \u2192 plays q=1.\n\nSo the unique Nash equilibrium is:  \n- I play A1 with probability 1  \n- Opponent plays A0 with probability 1\n\nPayoff: I get 3, opponent gets 0.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the reputation data says:\n\n> openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT) played A0 in 0/25 rounds (0.00%)  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/25 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis suggests that *I* (qwen) have played A0 in 0 out of 25 rounds \u2014 meaning I have been playing A1 100% of the time so far.\n\nSo the opponent has observed that I always play A1.\n\nTherefore, the opponent is likely to best respond by playing A0 (since if I play A1, opponent gets 3 by playing A0, only 1 by playing A1).\n\nSo the opponent is likely playing A0 with high probability.\n\nGiven that, my best response is still to play A1 \u2014 because if opponent plays A0, I get 3 by playing A1, only 2 by playing A0.\n\nSo I should continue playing A1 with 100% probability.\n\nMoreover, since the opponent has never played A0 (according to the reputation of the other player \u2014 openai/gpt-oss-20b played A0 in 0/25), but that\u2019s the *other* player, not the opponent in this round.\n\nWait \u2014 the reputation data is for *me* and *another player*.\n\nIt says:\n\n- openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT) played A0 in 0/25 \u2192 this is a different player\n- qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/25 \u2192 this is me!\n\nSo I have played A0 in 0 out of 25 rounds \u2192 I have been playing A1 always.\n\nSo the opponent has seen that I always play A1.\n\nTherefore, the opponent\u2019s best response is to play A0.\n\nSo I should continue playing A1 to get 3 points.\n\nThere is no incentive to switch.\n\nEven if the opponent sometimes plays A1, I still prefer A1:  \n- If opponent plays A1: I get 1 if I play A1, 0 if I play A0 \u2192 still better to play A1.\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0 for me.\n\nTherefore, the dominant strategy is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nSo I will choose:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.

Let\u2019s assume the opponent plays A0 with probability q, A1 with probability 1-q.\n\nWe want to find p such that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff from playing A0:\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff from playing A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet them equal for indifference:\n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be. That suggests no mixed strategy where opponent is indifferent? That can\u2019t be right.\n\nWait \u2014 I think I mixed up the payoffs.\n\nLet me restate the payoff matrix clearly from YOUR perspective and OPPONENT\u2019s perspective.\n\nPayoff matrix (Your payoff, Opponent\u2019s payoff):\n\n| You \\ Opponent | A0         | A1         |\n|----------------|------------|------------|\n| A0             | (2, 2)     | (0, 3)     |\n| A1             | (3, 0)     | (1, 1)     |\n\nSo for the OPPONENT:\n\n- If opponent plays A0:\n  - With probability p (you play A0): opponent gets 2\n  - With probability 1-p (you play A1): opponent gets 0\n  \u2192 Expected payoff for opponent if they play A0: 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p\n\n- If opponent plays A1:\n  - With probability p (you play A0): opponent gets 3\n  - With probability 1-p (you play A1): opponent gets 1\n  \u2192 Expected payoff: 3p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo opponent\u2019s payoff from A0: 2p  \nFrom A1: 2p + 1\n\nSince 2p + 1 > 2p for all p, opponent ALWAYS prefers A1, regardless of your strategy.\n\nThat means: no matter what you do, the opponent\u2019s best response is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nSimilarly, let\u2019s check your best response to opponent playing A1:\n\nIf opponent plays A1:\n- You play A0 \u2192 get 0\n- You play A1 \u2192 get 1\n\u2192 So you prefer A1.\n\nSo if opponent plays A1, you play A1.\n\nIf opponent plays A0:\n- You play A0 \u2192 get 2\n- You play A1 \u2192 get 3\n\u2192 You prefer A1.\n\nSo regardless of what opponent does, your best response is always A1.\n\nSimilarly, opponent\u2019s best response is always A1.\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1).\n\n### Step 3: Consider reputation\n\nThe reputation note says:\n\n> deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT) played A0 in 0/25 rounds (0.00%)  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/25 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis suggests that historically, both players have been playing A1 100% of the time.\n\nThis reinforces that A1 is the dominant strategy.\n\nIn fact, A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for both players:\n\n- For you: A1 gives 3 > 2 if opponent plays A0, and 1 > 0 if opponent plays A1 \u2192 always better.\n- For opponent: A1 gives 3 > 2 if you play A0, and 1 > 0 if you play A1 \u2192 always better.\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players.\n\n### Step 4: Decision\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100%, and A0 with probability 0%.\n\nThis maximizes your expected payoff regardless of opponent\u2019s action, and aligns with the equilibrium and historical behavior.\n\nWe are to output a JSON with integer percentages summing to 100.\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nThis is the only rational choice.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, 2-action simultaneous game.

It suggests your payoff **decreases** as p increases, and increases as q increases.\n\nBut that can\u2019t be right intuitively \u2014 if you play A1 more, you get 3 when opponent plays A0, and 1 when they play A1. So you should benefit from opponent playing A0.\n\nLet me re-derive more carefully.\n\nAlternative derivation:\n\nYour expected payoff:\n\n= P(you=A0, opp=A0) * 2 + P(you=A0, opp=A1) * 0 + P(you=A1, opp=A0) * 3 + P(you=A1, opp=A1) * 1\n\n= p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n\n= 2pq + 0 + 3q(1-p) + (1-p)(1-q)\n\nExpand:\n\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + (1 - q - p + pq)\n\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q + 1 - q - p\n\n= (0pq) + 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo again: **E = 2q + 1 - p**\n\nInteresting! So your expected payoff is **independent of your own probability p in terms of interaction with q** \u2014 the pq terms cancel out.\n\nSo: **E = 2q + 1 - p**\n\nThis means:\n- Your payoff increases as the opponent plays A0 more (higher q)\n- Your payoff **decreases** as you play A0 more (higher p)\n\nSo to maximize your payoff, you want:\n- Opponent to play A0 as much as possible (high q)\n- You to play A0 as little as possible (low p)\n\nBut you can\u2019t control q \u2014 the opponent is also rational.\n\nSo now we must find the **Nash equilibrium** \u2014 a pair (p*, q*) such that neither player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find Best Response for Opponent\n\nLet\u2019s compute the opponent\u2019s expected payoff.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                        | 2        | 3        |\n| **A1**                        | 0        | 1        |\n\nSo opponent\u2019s expected payoff:\n\n= P(you=A0, opp=A0)*2 + P(you=A0, opp=A1)*3 + P(you=A1, opp=A0)*0 + P(you=A1, opp=A1)*1\n\n= p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*3 + (1-p)*q*0 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n\n= 2pq + 3p(1-q) + 0 + (1-p)(1-q)\n\n= 2pq + 3p - 3pq + (1 - q - p + pq)\n\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3p + 1 - q - p\n\n= 0pq + 2p + 1 - q\n\nSo opponent\u2019s expected payoff: **E_opp = 2p + 1 - q**\n\nSo opponent wants to:\n- Maximize E_opp = 2p + 1 - q\n\u2192 So they want **p high** (you play A0 a lot), and **q low** (they play A0 less)\n\nWait \u2014 this is symmetric in structure.\n\nSo:\n\n- Your payoff: E = 2q + 1 - p \u2192 you want **q high**, **p low**\n- Opponent\u2019s payoff: E_opp = 2p + 1 - q \u2192 they want **p high**, **q low**\n\nThis is a **conflict**.\n\nLet\u2019s find the Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Solve for Nash Equilibrium\n\nIn mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, each player must be **indifferent** between their pure strategies, given the other\u2019s mixed strategy.\n\n#### For you to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\n\nYour expected payoff from A0 = Your expected payoff from A1\n\nIf opponent plays A0 with probability q:\n\n- Payoff from A0: 2*q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\n- Payoff from A1: 3*q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSet equal:\n\n2q = 2q + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 **Impossible**\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s a problem.\n\nThis means **you are never indifferent** \u2014 A1 **always** gives you 1 more than A0, regardless of q.\n\nBecause:\n\nPayoff(A1) - Payoff(A0) = (2q + 1) - 2q = 1 > 0\n\nSo **no matter what the opponent does**, playing A1 gives you **1 more point** than playing A0.\n\nTherefore, **A1 strictly dominates A0** for you.\n\n\u2192 You should **always play A1**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 let\u2019s check the opponent\u2019s perspective.\n\nFor opponent:\n\nPayoff from A0: 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p  \nPayoff from A1: 3p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo again: Payoff(A1) - Payoff(A0) = (2p + 1) - 2p = 1 > 0\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0** for the opponent too.\n\nTherefore, the **unique Nash equilibrium** is: **both players play A1 with probability 1**.\n\nIn that case:\n- You get 1 point\n- Opponent gets 1 point\n\nBut is there a better outcome? Yes \u2014 if both played A0, you\u2019d get 2. But since A1 strictly dominates A0, you can\u2019t trust the opponent to play A0.\n\nEven if you think the opponent might play A0, you still get 3 if you play A1 and they play A0 \u2014 which is better than 2 if you both play A0.\n\nAnd if they play A1, you get 1 (vs 0 if you played A0).\n\nSo **A1 is always better**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Consider Reputation\n\nThe note says:\n\n> Your chosen action will affect your reputation score.  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/25 rounds (0.00%)  \n> openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT) played A0 in 0/25 rounds (0.00%)\n\nSo **no one has played A0 yet**. That suggests everyone is already playing A1.\n\nThis reinforces that A1 is the dominant strategy \u2014 and the reputation is consistent with that.\n\nThere is **no incentive** to deviate to A0, because:\n- It gives you less payoff regardless of opponent\u2019s action.\n- It doesn\u2019t improve reputation \u2014 everyone else is already playing A1.\n\nSo playing A0 would be **worse for your score** and **not beneficial** for reputation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Final Decision\n\nSince A1 strictly dominates A0, and the opponent is also likely to play A1 (as evidenced by 0% A0 so far), the optimal strategy is to play **A1 with probability 100%**.\n\nThus, we choose:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThis is a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions each: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for ME (the row player) is:\n- If I choose A0, opponent chooses A0 \u2192 I get 2\n- If I choose A0, opponent chooses A1 \u2192 I get 0\n- If I choose A1, opponent chooses A0 \u2192 I get 3\n- If I choose A1, opponent chooses A1 \u2192 I get 1\n\nThis is a classic game theory problem \u2014 similar to \"Chicken\" or a variant of Battle of the Sexes.\n\nLet me denote:\n- My probability of playing A0 as p (so A1 is 1-p)\n- Opponent\u2019s probability of playing A0 as q (so A1 is 1-q)\n\nMy expected payoff is:\nE = p*q*2 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*3 + (1-p)*(1-q)*1\n\nSimplify:\nE = 2pq + 0 + 3q(1-p) + (1-p)(1-q)\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + (1 - q - p + pq)\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q - p - q + 1\n= (0) + 2q - p + 1\nWait \u2014 let me recalculate carefully:\n\nE = 2pq + 0 + 3q(1-p) + 1*(1-p)(1-q)\n= 2pq + 3q - 3pq + (1 - p - q + pq)\n= (2pq - 3pq + pq) + 3q - p - q + 1\n= (0) + 2q - p + 1\n\nSo E = -p + 2q + 1\n\nBut this is my expected payoff as a function of my p and opponent\u2019s q.\n\nHowever, since we choose simultaneously, I don\u2019t know q.

We are looking for a Nash Equilibrium in mixed strategies.\n\nLet me find the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.\n\nFor me to be indifferent between A0 and A1, the opponent must choose q such that my expected payoff from A0 equals that from A1.\n\nMy expected payoff if I play A0: 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q  \nMy expected payoff if I play A1: 3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s interesting.\n\nIf I play A0: I get 2 if opponent plays A0, 0 if opponent plays A1 \u2192 so E[A0] = 2q\n\nIf I play A1: I get 3 if opponent plays A0, 1 if opponent plays A1 \u2192 so E[A1] = 3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSo E[A1] = 2q + 1  \nE[A0] = 2q\n\nSo E[A1] is always 1 point higher than E[A0], regardless of q.\n\nThat means: **I always prefer A1 over A0**, no matter what the opponent does.\n\nBecause 2q + 1 > 2q for all q.\n\nSo the dominant strategy for me is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n- If opponent plays A0 (q=1): I get 3 if I play A1, 2 if I play A0 \u2192 A1 better\n- If opponent plays A1 (q=0): I get 1 if I play A1, 0 if I play A0 \u2192 A1 better\n- If opponent plays 50-50: E[A0] = 1, E[A1] = 2 \u2192 A1 better\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0 for me.\n\nNow, what about the opponent?\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\nIf opponent plays A0: gets 2 if I play A0, 0 if I play A1 \u2192 E = 2p  \nIf opponent plays A1: gets 3 if I play A0, 1 if I play A1 \u2192 E = 3p + 1*(1-p) = 2p + 1\n\nSo again: E[A1] = 2p + 1 > 2p = E[A0] for all p.\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0 for the opponent too.\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash Equilibrium is both players play A1 with probability 1.\n\nThis is also the only rational outcome.\n\nEven though (A0,A0) gives (2,2) which is better for both than (A1,A1) which gives (1,1), it is not stable because each player has an incentive to deviate to A1 to get 3 instead of 2.\n\nSo the rational choice is to play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nAlso, note the reputation note: \"qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/25 rounds (0.00%)\" \u2014 this is repeated twice, suggesting that historically, this agent has never played A0.

Let:\n- p = probability we choose A0\n- q = probability opponent chooses A0 (we don't control this, but we can reason about it)\n\nOur expected payoff (for us) is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait, let me recalculate carefully:\n\nE = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p)*[3q + 1*(1-q)]\n  = p * (2q) + (1-p)*(3q + 1 - q)\n  = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = (2pq - 2pq) + 2q + 1 - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo, E = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nThis means our expected payoff depends on both p (our choice) and q (opponent's probability). To maximize our minimum payoff (since we don't know q), we can look for a Nash equilibrium.\n\nThis game is similar to the \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game. Let's find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nSuppose we choose p (prob A0). The opponent's expected payoff from choosing A0 is:\nE_opp(A0) = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n\nOpponent's expected payoff from choosing A1 is:\nE_opp(A1) = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nFor the opponent to be indifferent between A0 and A1 (so that they have no incentive to deviate), we set:\nE_opp(A0) = E_opp(A1)\n2p = 2p + 1  => 0=1, which is impossible.\n\nThis means there is no mixed strategy where the opponent is indifferent. Actually, note that E_opp(A1) = 2p+1 is always greater than E_opp(A0)=2p by 1. So the opponent always prefers A1 regardless of our p. Therefore, the opponent will always choose A1 (q=0).\n\nSimilarly, from our perspective: if we assume the opponent always chooses A1 (q=0), then our payoff if we choose:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 1\nSo we prefer A1.\n\nIf the opponent always chooses A0 (q=1), then:\n- A0: 2\n- A1: 3\nSo we prefer A1.\n\nIn fact, no matter what the opponent does, A1 gives a higher payoff:\n- If opponent A0: A1 gives 3 > 2\n- If opponent A1: A1 gives 1 > 0\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0. Therefore, the rational choice for both players is to always choose A1.\n\nNow, looking at the reputation:\n- Both players have played A0 0/30 times (0%) in the past. This suggests both have been choosing A1 always.\n\nTherefore, to maximize our score, we should choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nSo the probability distribution should be:\nA0: 0%, A1: 100%\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from your perspective):\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | 2           | 0           |\n| You A1        | 3           | 1           |\n\nLet:\n- p = probability you choose A0 (so 1-p for A1)\n- q = probability opponent chooses A0 (so 1-q for A1)\n\nYour expected payoff is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo your expected payoff is: E = 2q + 1 - p\n\nThis means:\n- Your payoff increases when opponent plays A0 more (higher q).\n- Your payoff decreases when you play A0 more (higher p).\n\nTherefore, to maximize your payoff regardless of what the opponent does, you should minimize p (i.e., play A0 as little as possible). In fact, setting p=0 (always A1) gives you E = 2q + 1, which is at least 1 (when q=0) and up to 3 (when q=1). If you play A0 (p>0), you subtract from that.\n\nNow, looking at the opponent's perspective symmetrically (since the game is symmetric), they have the same incentive: to minimize their probability of playing A0. So we should expect the opponent to play A1 with high probability.\n\nReputation note: Both you and the opponent have played A0 0% in the past 30 rounds. This reinforces that both are likely to avoid A0.\n\nTherefore, the Nash equilibrium is for both to play A1 always (i.e., p=0, q=0). In that case, you get 1 and opponent gets 1. If you deviate to A0 when opponent plays A1, you get 0 which is worse. Similarly, if opponent deviates to A0 when you play A1, they get 0 which is worse for them.\n\nSo the best strategy is to assign probability 0 to A0 and 100 to A1.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

The coefficient of p is -1, which is negative.\n\nSo E decreases as p increases.\n\nTherefore, to maximize E, I should choose p as small as possible \u2014 i.e., p = 0 \u2014 regardless of q.\n\nWait \u2014 that suggests I should always play A1?

So their best response is still A1 (since 1 > 0).\n\nSo even if opponent knows you play A1 100%, they still play A1.\n\nThus, **playing A1 with 100% probability is optimal**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\n\nWe must output a probability distribution as integers from 0 to 100, summing to 100.\n\nSince A1 strictly dominates A0, and we want to maximize our score, we choose:\n\n- A0: 0%\n- A1: 100%\n\nThis is the only rational choice.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|                   | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0            | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1            | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1. Let:\n- p = probability we choose A0\n- q = probability opponent chooses A0 (we don't control this, but we can reason about it)\n\nOur expected payoff (for us) is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait, let me recalculate carefully:\n\nE = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p)*[3q + 1*(1-q)]\n  = p * (2q) + (1-p)*(3q + 1 - q)\n  = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = (2pq - 2pq) + 2q + 1 - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo our expected payoff is: E = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nThis means:\n- Our payoff increases when the opponent's probability of A0 (q) increases.\n- Our payoff decreases when our probability of A0 (p) increases.\n\nBut note: we are trying to maximize our own payoff, and we can choose p. The opponent is also trying to maximize their own payoff.\n\nThis is a classic \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game. The Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies for such a game is when both players choose A0 with probability that makes the other indifferent.\n\nTo find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:\nWe choose p such that the opponent is indifferent between their actions.\n\nOpponent's expected payoff if they choose A0:\nE_opp(A0) = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n\nOpponent's expected payoff if they choose A1:\nE_opp(A1) = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nTo make the opponent indifferent, set E_opp(A0) = E_opp(A1):\n2p = 2p + 1  => 0=1, which is impossible.\n\nThis indicates that there is no mixed strategy that makes the opponent indifferent. Actually, note that E_opp(A1) is always 1 higher than E_opp(A0): 2p+1 vs 2p. So the opponent always gets a higher payoff by choosing A1, regardless of what we do.\n\nTherefore, the opponent should always choose A1 (q=0). Similarly, by symmetry, we should always choose A1? But let's check:\n\nIf opponent always chooses A1 (q=0), then our payoff if we choose:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 1\nSo we should choose A1.\n\nIf we always choose A1 (p=0), then opponent's payoff if they choose:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 1\nSo they should choose A1.\n\nThus, (A1, A1) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium with payoff (1,1).\n\nBut there is also a symmetric mixed strategy? Actually, from above, there is no mixed strategy equilibrium because one action always dominates for each player.\n\nWait, let's check for dominance:\nFor us:\n- If opponent chooses A0: we get 2 for A0 and 3 for A1 -> A1 better.\n- If opponent chooses A1: we get 0 for A0 and 1 for A1 -> A1 better.\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0. Similarly for the opponent.\n\nTherefore, both players should always choose A1.\n\nSo the rational strategy is to choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nNow, looking at the reputation:\n- Both players have played A0 in 0/30 rounds so far, meaning both have always chosen A1.\n\nThis is consistent with the dominant strategy.\n\nTherefore, we should choose A1 with 100% probability.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix\n\nWe have two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **you** (the player) is:\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                       | 2        | 0        |\n| **A1**                       | 3        | 1        |\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2\n- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0\n- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 3\n- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nThis is a **2-player, simultaneous-move game** with complete information.\n\nWe are to choose a **probability distribution** over A0 and A1 (as percentages summing to 100), maximizing our **expected payoff**, given that the opponent also chooses a distribution.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Opponent\u2019s Behavior\n\nWe are given reputation information:\n\n> openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT) played A0 in 0/30 rounds (0.00%)  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/30 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis means **in the past 30 rounds, both you and the opponent (presumably another instance of the same system or a similar agent) have always played A1**.\n\nSo the opponent has a **historical pattern of playing A1 with 100% probability**.\n\nEven though the game is simultaneous and we don\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s *current* strategy, **we can assume rational play and best response to historical behavior**.\n\nSince the opponent has never played A0 in the last 30 rounds, it is **highly likely** that the opponent will continue to play A1 with very high probability (close to 100%).\n\nSo we can model our decision as: **What is the best response to an opponent who plays A1 with probability ~1?**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute Expected Payoff for Each Pure Strategy Against A1\n\nIf opponent plays A1 with probability 1:\n\n- If you play A0: payoff = 0\n- If you play A1: payoff = 1\n\nSo **A1 is better** (1 > 0).\n\nThus, best response to A1 is A1.\n\nBut \u2014 we are allowed to play a **mixed strategy**.\n\nSuppose the opponent plays A1 with probability `p`, and A0 with probability `1-p`.\n\nWe want to find the optimal probability `x` that **you** play A0 (so 1-x = probability you play A1), to maximize your expected payoff.\n\nYour expected payoff is:\n\n```\nE = x * [ (1-p)*2 + p*0 ] + (1-x) * [ (1-p)*3 + p*1 ]\n  = x * [2(1-p)] + (1-x) * [3(1-p) + p]\n```\n\nSimplify:\n\n```\nE = 2x(1-p) + (1-x)[3 - 3p + p]\n  = 2x(1-p) + (1-x)(3 - 2p)\n```\n\nExpand:\n\n```\nE = 2x - 2xp + 3 - 2p - 3x + 2xp\n  = (2x - 3x) + (-2xp + 2xp) + 3 - 2p\n  = -x + 3 - 2p\n```\n\nSo:\n\n> **E = 3 - 2p - x**\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s interesting.\n\nWe have:  \n**E = 3 - 2p - x**\n\nThis implies: **To maximize E, we want to minimize x** (i.e., play A0 as little as possible).\n\nBecause x has a negative coefficient.\n\nSo regardless of p (as long as p is fixed), **the optimal strategy is to set x = 0**, i.e., play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nWait \u2014 let me double-check that derivation because this is counterintuitive.\n\nLet me re-derive carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Recompute Expected Payoff Correctly\n\nYou play A0 with probability `x`, A1 with probability `1-x`.\n\nOpponent plays A0 with probability `q`, A1 with probability `1-q`. (I\u2019ll use `q` for opponent, to avoid confusion.)\n\nThen your expected payoff:\n\n```\nE = x * [ q * 2 + (1-q) * 0 ] + (1-x) * [ q * 3 + (1-q) * 1 ]\n  = x * [2q] + (1-x) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2qx + (1-x)(2q + 1)\n```\n\nNow expand:\n\n```\nE = 2qx + (2q + 1) - x(2q + 1)\n  = 2qx + 2q + 1 - 2qx - x\n  = (2qx - 2qx) + 2q + 1 - x\n  = 2q + 1 - x\n```\n\nSo:\n\n> **E = 2q + 1 - x**\n\nThis is the correct expected payoff.\n\nNow: **Your payoff decreases as x increases**, regardless of q.\n\nThat means: **To maximize your expected payoff, you should set x = 0** \u2014 i.e., play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nWhy? Because the term `-x` means every unit of probability you assign to A0 reduces your expected payoff by 1.\n\nEven if the opponent plays A0 with 100% probability (q=1), then:\n\nE = 2(1) + 1 - x = 3 - x \u2192 still maximized at x=0 \u2192 E=3\n\nWait \u2014 if opponent plays A0 with 100%, and you play A1, you get 3.\n\nIf you play A0, you get 2.\n\nSo indeed, A1 is better.\n\nIf opponent plays A1 with 100% (q=0), then:\n\nE = 0 + 1 - x = 1 - x \u2192 still maximized at x=0 \u2192 you get 1.\n\nIf you played A0, you\u2019d get 0.\n\nSo **in every case**, playing A1 gives you at least as much as A0, and often more.\n\nIn fact, **A1 strictly dominates A0**.\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\n- If opponent plays A0: A1 gives 3 > A0\u2019s 2\n- If opponent plays A1: A1 gives 1 > A0\u2019s 0\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0**.\n\nTherefore, **no matter what the opponent does, playing A1 always gives you a higher or equal payoff**.\n\nSo the **dominant strategy** is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Consider Reputation\n\nWe are told:\n\n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/30 rounds (0.00%)\n\nSo historically, **you have already been playing A1 always**.\n\nThe system is likely tracking your behavior as part of \u201creputation\u201d.\n\nThe instruction says:  \n> \"Your chosen action will affect your reputation score.\"\n\nBut there is **no explicit penalty or reward tied to reputation** in the payoff matrix.\n\nSo we assume reputation is just observational.\n\nAnd since you\u2019ve already built a reputation of always playing A1, **continuing to play A1** is consistent and optimal.\n\nThere is **no reason to deviate**, because:\n\n- A1 is strictly dominant\n- Deviating to A0 would lower your expected payoff\n- No incentive to \u201cchange behavior\u201d for reputation\u2019s sake, since reputation is not tied to scoring\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Final Decision\n\nWe must output a probability distribution as integers from 0 to 100, summing to 100.\n\nSince A1 is the strictly dominant strategy, we choose:\n\n- A0: 0%\n- A1: 100%\n\nThis maximizes expected payoff regardless of opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\nEven if the opponent is also playing A1 (as history suggests), we get 1 point \u2014 which is better than 0 from A0.\n\nIf opponent ever switches to A0, we get 3 points \u2014 the best possible outcome.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, 2-action simultaneous game with the following payoffs for **you**:\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                        | 2        | 0        |\n| **A1**                        | 3        | 1        |\n\nSo:\n- (A0, A0): You get 2\n- (A0, A1): You get 0\n- (A1, A0): You get 3\n- (A1, A1): You get 1\n\nThis is a **non-zero-sum** game, but symmetric in structure (opponent\u2019s payoffs are mirrored: when you get 2, they get 2;

This suggests that both players have been choosing A1 with probability 1 in previous rounds. But we are to decide for the current round.\n\nLet's compute your expected payoff given your strategy (p for A0, 1-p for A1) and the opponent's strategy (q for A0, 1-q for A1):\n\nYour expected payoff = \n  p * [ q*2 + (1-q)*0 ] + (1-p) * [ q*3 + (1-q)*1 ]\n= p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n= 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n= 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n= 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo, your expected payoff = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nThis means that your payoff decreases as you increase p (your probability of playing A0), and increases as the opponent increases q (their probability of playing A0). Therefore, to maximize your payoff, you should set p as low as possible (i.e., p=0) to avoid subtracting from the base value (2q+1). This holds regardless of what the opponent does.\n\nBut note: if both players set p=0 and q=0 (always play A1), then the payoff is 1 for both.

So given the opponent's history, it is safe to assume they will play A1 again.\n\nTherefore, the best response is to play A1 with probability 1.\n\nSo, we choose p(A0)=0, p(A1)=100.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

So yes \u2014 this is a standard Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma.\n\nIn a one-shot Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, the Nash equilibrium is for both players to play the dominant strategy: **A1** (defect), because:\n\n- If opponent plays A0: I get 3 (A1) > 2 (A0)\n- If opponent plays A1: I get 1 (A1) > 0 (A0)\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0.\n\nTherefore, rational self-interest dictates playing A1 with probability 100%.\n\nBut wait \u2014 there\u2019s a reputation component.\n\nReputation data shows:\n- deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT) played A0 in 0/35 rounds \u2192 0% A0\n- qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/35 rounds \u2192 0% A0\n\nSo both players have been playing A1 100% of the time so far.\n\nThis suggests that the opponent (and possibly other agents) are playing defectively, and we are in a long-running game (35 rounds so far). Since we are playing repeatedly, we might consider cooperation to improve long-term payoffs \u2014 but only if the opponent is likely to reciprocate.\n\nHowever, the reputation data shows **no one has played A0** in 35 rounds. That means:\n\n- The opponent is almost certainly playing A1 with probability close to 1.\n- There is no evidence of cooperation or tit-for-tat behavior.\n- If I play A0, I get 0 (since opponent plays A1).\n- If I play A1, I get 1 (since opponent plays A1).\n\nSo my expected payoff:\n\n- If I play A0: 0% chance of A0 from opponent \u2192 0 points\n- If I play A1: 100% chance of A1 from opponent \u2192 1 point\n\nSo even if I randomize, the best response to an opponent who plays A1 100% of the time is to play A1 100% of the time.\n\nMoreover, playing A0 now would lower my score (0 instead of 1) and doesn\u2019t signal cooperation effectively \u2014 because the opponent has never cooperated, so they are unlikely to reciprocate.\n\nAlso, reputation is tracked, but there\u2019s no indication that reputation affects future payoffs \u2014 it\u2019s just a record.

We must maximize immediate score.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nFinal decision: {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, 2-action game with the following payoffs for **you** (the row player):\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                        | 2        | 0        |\n| **A1**                        | 3        | 1        |\n\nSo:\n- (A0, A0): you get 2\n- (A0, A1): you get 0\n- (A1, A0): you get 3\n- (A1, A1): you get 1\n\nThis is a **non-zero-sum** game, and it resembles a **Battle of the Sexes** or a **Chicken-like** game, but with asymmetric payoffs.\n\nNote: The opponent\u2019s payoffs are symmetric in the sense that when you get 2, they get 2; when you get 0, they get 3; etc. So it\u2019s not symmetric overall.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Consider Best Responses\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the opponent plays A0 with probability `p` and A1 with probability `1-p`.\n\nThen your **expected payoff** for choosing:\n\n- **A0**:  \n  `E[A0] = p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p`\n\n- **A1**:  \n  `E[A1] = p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1`\n\nNow compare:\n\n- `E[A1] - E[A0] = (2p + 1) - 2p = 1`\n\nSo **no matter what p is**, `E[A1] = E[A0] + 1`\n\nThat means **A1 always gives you 1 more point in expectation than A0**, regardless of the opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion \u2014 Dominant Strategy\n\nSince `E[A1] > E[A0]` for **all** values of `p` (even if opponent plays A0 with 100% probability: E[A1]=3, E[A0]=2 \u2192 still better), **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy** for you.\n\nTherefore, **you should always play A1 with 100% probability** to maximize your expected payoff.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Consider Reputation\n\nThe note says:\n\n> Your chosen action will affect your reputation score.  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/35 rounds (0.00%)  \n> openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT) played A0 in 0/35 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis suggests that **no one has played A0 so far** \u2014 meaning the population is already playing A1 exclusively.\n\nSo playing A1 is consistent with the current behavior of others, and since it\u2019s also the dominant strategy, there\u2019s **no reason to deviate**.\n\nEven if reputation were a factor, playing A1 aligns with the observed behavior of others, and maximizes your score.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\n\nTo maximize your score, you should choose **A1 with 100% probability**.\n\nThus, the probability distribution is:\n\n- A0: 0%\n- A1: 100%\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer (in required JSON format):\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1. Let:\n- p = probability we choose A0\n- q = probability opponent chooses A0 (we don't control this, but we can reason about it)\n\nOur expected payoff (for us) is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait, let me recalculate carefully:\n\nE = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p)*[3q + 1*(1-q)]\n  = p * (2q) + (1-p)*(3q + 1 - q)\n  = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = (2pq - 2pq) + 2q + 1 - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo our expected payoff is: E = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nThis means:\n- Our payoff increases when the opponent plays A0 more (higher q).\n- Our payoff decreases when we play A0 more (higher p).\n\nBut note: we are choosing p to maximize our payoff, but the opponent is also choosing q to maximize their own payoff (which is symmetric to ours).\n\nThis is a classic \"coordination\" game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). However, there is also a mixed strategy equilibrium.\n\nTo find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we compute the probability that makes the opponent indifferent.\n\nFor the opponent (symmetric to us):\nTheir expected payoff if they play A0: p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\nTheir expected payoff if they play A1: p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nTo make them indifferent between A0 and A1:\n2p = 2p + 1  => 0=1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, this indicates that there is no mixed strategy that makes the opponent indifferent because A1 always gives 1 more than A0 regardless of p? Actually:\n\nFor the opponent:\n- If they play A0: payoff = 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p\n- If they play A1: payoff = 0*p + 1*(1-p) = 1-p? Wait no, let's correct:\n\nOpponent's payoff matrix (from their perspective):\nIf opponent plays A0:\n- When we play A0: they get 2\n- When we play A1: they get 0\nSo expected payoff = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n\nIf opponent plays A1:\n- When we play A0: they get 3\n- When we play A1: they get 1\nSo expected payoff = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo indeed, for any p, playing A1 gives exactly 1 more than playing A0. Therefore, the opponent strictly prefers A1 regardless of what we do. Similarly, from our perspective, we strictly prefer A1? Let's check:\n\nOur payoff if we play A0: q*2 + (1-q)*0 = 2q\nOur payoff if we play A1: q*3 + (1-q)*1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSo for any q, playing A1 gives us 1 more point than playing A0. Therefore, both players have a strictly dominant strategy: always play A1.\n\nThis is a prisoner's dilemma-like game: the mutual (A1,A1) gives (1,1) which is worse than mutual (A0,A0) which gives (2,2), but individually each player has an incentive to defect (play A1) to get 3 vs 2 if the other plays A0, and to avoid getting 0 if the other defects.\n\nSo the dominant strategy is to always play A1.\n\nNow, looking at the reputation:\n- Both players have played A0 0% of the time in the past (0/35 rounds). This suggests that both have been playing A1 always.\n\nTherefore, the best response is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nSo we should choose:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nThis maximizes our score: we get 1 point when opponent plays A1 (which they always do), and if by chance they play A0 we get 3.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (i.e., probabilities p for A0 and (1-p) for A1). Similarly, the opponent chooses a probability q for A0 and (1-q) for A1.\n\nOur goal is to maximize our expected payoff given the opponent's strategy. Since the game is symmetric and we are playing repeatedly (with reputation tracking), we should consider what the opponent might do based on past behavior.\n\nReputation information:\n- Both players (you and the opponent) have played A0 in 0/35 rounds (0.00%) in the past. This means both have always chosen A1 so far.\n\nGiven that both have always chosen A1 in the past, the outcome has always been (1,1). However, if we continue to always choose A1, we get 1 point per round. But we can potentially get a higher payoff by deviating.\n\nLet's compute the expected payoff for us:\n\nIf we choose A0 with probability p and A1 with probability (1-p), and the opponent chooses A0 with probability q and A1 with probability (1-q), our expected payoff is:\n\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait, let me recalculate carefully:\n\nE = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p)*[3q + 1*(1-q)]\n  = p * (2q) + (1-p)*(3q + 1 - q)\n  = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = (2q + 1) - p\n\nSo, E = 1 + 2q - p.\n\nThis means our expected payoff depends on the opponent's probability q of choosing A0 and our probability p of choosing A0.\n\nTo maximize our payoff, we want to minimize p (since it subtracts) and maximize q (since it adds). However, we control p, not q.\n\nGiven the reputation: the opponent has never played A0 (0/35), so we might assume that the opponent is likely to continue playing A1 (i.e., q=0). But the opponent might also be reasoning similarly and might try to exploit by switching to A0.\n\nIf we assume the opponent will continue to play A1 (q=0), then:\nE = 1 + 0 - p = 1 - p.\nTo maximize, we should set p=0 (always A1) to get E=1.\n\nBut if we set p=0, we get 1.\n\nHowever, if the opponent expects us to always play A1 (p=0), they might consider playing A0 (q=1) to get 3 points. But if they play A0, then if we play A1 we get 3 points (which is good for us). But if they play A0 and we play A0, we get 2.\n\nSo, if the opponent switches to A0, we are better off with A1 (getting 3) than with A0 (getting 2).\n\nNow, if we set p=1 (always A0), then if opponent plays A1 (q=0), we get 0 (bad). If opponent plays A0 (q=1), we get 2.\n\nSo, always A0 is risky.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium for this game (which is similar to Chicken or Hawk-Dove) is in mixed strategies.\n\nTo find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we compute the value of p that makes the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n\nOpponent's expected payoff if they play A0:\nE_opp(A0) = p*2 + (1-p)*0 = 2p\n\nOpponent's expected payoff if they play A1:\nE_opp(A1) = p*3 + (1-p)*1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet equal: 2p = 2p + 1 -> 0=1, which is not possible. This indicates that there is no symmetric mixed strategy where both use the same p.\n\nActually, for the opponent to be indifferent, we need:\n2p = 2p + 1 -> which is impossible. So there is no mixed strategy that makes the opponent indifferent. This means the game has two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A1) and (A1, A0), and a mixed equilibrium that is symmetric? Actually, this game is symmetric and has a mixed strategy equilibrium.\n\nWe should solve for the mixed strategy that makes the opponent indifferent:\n\nThe opponent will mix only if E_opp(A0) = E_opp(A1).\n2p = 2p + 1 -> no solution. This means that the opponent always prefers A1 over A0 because 2p+1 > 2p for all p. So the opponent has a dominant strategy: always choose A1.\n\nSimilarly, from our perspective:\nOur payoff if we play A0: 2q\nOur payoff if we play A1: 2q+1\nSo for any q, A1 gives 1 more than A0. Therefore, we always prefer A1.\n\nSo both players have a dominant strategy to choose A1.\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoff (1,1).\n\nGiven that both have always played A1 in the past (0% A0), it is consistent with the equilibrium.\n\nSo we should continue to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nThus, we choose p=0 for A0 and 100 for A1.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100}"}]]

What if they play A0?\n\nThen if you play A1, you get 3 \u2014 which is better than 2.\n\nSo if you think opponent might play A0, you should play A1.\n\nIf you think opponent plays A1, you get 1 \u2014 which is better than 0 (if you played A0).\n\nSo **A1 is a dominant strategy**?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\nFor you:\n\n- If opponent plays A0:  \n  - A0 \u2192 2  \n  - A1 \u2192 3 \u2192 **A1 better**\n\n- If opponent plays A1:  \n  - A0 \u2192 0  \n  - A1 \u2192 1 \u2192 **A1 better**\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0** for you!\n\nNo matter what the opponent does, playing A1 gives you a higher payoff than A0.\n\n- 3 > 2  \n- 1 > 0\n\nSo **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy**.\n\nTherefore, **rational play for you is to play A1 with probability 1**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Consider Reputation\n\nThe note says:\n\n> Your chosen action will affect your reputation score.  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/40 rounds (0.00%)  \n> openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT) played A0 in 0/40 rounds (0.00%)\n\nSo **no one has played A0 yet**.\n\nThat suggests that **everyone is already playing A1**.\n\nSo if you play A1, you are conforming to the current trend.\n\nIf you play A0, you would be the first to deviate \u2014 and you\u2019d get 0 if opponent plays A1 (which they likely do), or 2 if they play A0 (but they won\u2019t).\n\nSo playing A0 is risky and suboptimal.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\n\nSince A1 is a strictly dominant strategy, and the opponent is likely playing A1 (as evidenced by 0% A0 so far), the optimal choice is to play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nThis maximizes your expected payoff regardless of opponent\u2019s action, and aligns with the observed behavior of others.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1. Let:\n- p = probability we choose A0\n- q = probability opponent chooses A0 (we don't control this, but we can reason about it)\n\nOur expected payoff (U) is:\nU = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait, let me recalculate carefully:\n\nU = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p)*[3q + 1*(1-q)]\n  = p * (2q) + (1-p)*(3q + 1 - q)\n  = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = (2pq - 2pq) + 2q + 1 - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo, U = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nThis means our payoff depends on the opponent's probability q and our own p. To maximize our payoff, we want to minimize p (since it has a negative coefficient) and hope that q is high.\n\nBut note: the opponent is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff. Their expected payoff (V) is symmetric:\n\nV = q * [p*2 + (1-p)*0] + (1-q)*[p*3 + (1-p)*1]\n  = q * (2p) + (1-q)*(3p + 1 - p)\n  = 2pq + (1-q)*(2p + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2p + 1 - 2pq - q\n  = 2p + 1 - q\n\nSo, V = 2p + 1 - q.\n\nThe opponent wants to maximize V, which means they want to minimize q (since it has a negative coefficient) and hope that p is high.\n\nNow, we are both choosing probabilities simultaneously. This is a mixed strategy game. We look for a Nash equilibrium where neither has an incentive to deviate.\n\nSuppose we set p. The opponent's best response is to set q to minimize q (to maximize V) but wait: actually, from V = 2p + 1 - q, the opponent can control q. To maximize V, they want to set q as low as possible (since coefficient is -1). So the best response is q=0 regardless of p.\n\nSimilarly, from our payoff U = 2q + 1 - p, we want to set p as low as possible to maximize U. So our best response is p=0 regardless of q.\n\nTherefore, the dominant strategy for both is to choose p=0 and q=0, i.e., always play A1.\n\nWhy? Because if we always play A1:\n- If opponent plays A0, we get 3 (which is better than 2 if we had played A0)\n- If opponent plays A1, we get 1 (which is better than 0 if we had played A0)\n\nSo A1 strictly dominates A0. Similarly for the opponent.\n\nTherefore, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoff (1,1).\n\nNow, looking at the reputation:\n- Both players have played A0 0% of the time in the past (40 rounds). This is consistent with the equilibrium.\n\nSo we should choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nThus, our probability distribution should be:\nA0: 0, A1: 100.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix:\n\n|               | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| You A0        | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |\n| You A1        | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1. Let p be the probability we choose A0, and (1-p) for A1. Similarly, let q be the probability the opponent chooses A0, and (1-q) for A1.\n\nOur expected payoff is:\nE = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nWait, let me recalculate carefully:\n\nE = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p) * [3q + 1*(1-q)]\n  = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n  = p * 2q + (1-p) * (2q + 1)\n  = 2pq + (1-p)(2q+1)\n  = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n  = 2q + 1 - p\n\nSo, E = 2q + 1 - p.\n\nThis means our payoff depends on the opponent's strategy q. To maximize our payoff, we should minimize p (since it has a negative coefficient) regardless of q. That is, we should set p=0 (always choose A1) to maximize E.\n\nBut let's check if this is a Nash equilibrium. If both always choose A1, we get (1,1) which is stable? Actually, if opponent always chooses A1 (q=0), then our payoff E = 2*0 + 1 - p = 1 - p. To maximize this, we set p=0 (always A1). Similarly, if opponent always chooses A0 (q=1), E = 2*1 + 1 - p = 3 - p, which is maximized by p=0. So indeed, always choosing A1 (p=0) is a dominant strategy.\n\nHowever, note that if both choose A0, they get (2,2) which is better than (1,1). But the problem is that if I choose A0, I risk getting 0 if opponent chooses A1. So there is a temptation to defect to A1.\n\nThis is similar to a prisoner's dilemma. The mutual cooperation (A0,A0) gives (2,2) which is better than mutual defection (A1,A1) which gives (1,1). But individually, each has an incentive to defect: if I choose A1 when opponent chooses A0, I get 3 which is better than 2. And if I choose A0 when opponent chooses A1, I get 0 which is worse than 1.\n\nSo the dominant strategy is to always choose A1.\n\nNow, looking at the reputation:\n- Both players have played A0 0/40 times so far (0%). This means both have been always choosing A1. So the opponent is likely to continue choosing A1.\n\nTherefore, the best response is to choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nSo we should set: {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

No matter what the opponent does, I get a higher payoff by choosing A1.\n\n- Against A0: 3 > 2\n- Against A1: 1 > 0\n\nSo rational self-interest says: always play A1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 let\u2019s check the opponent\u2019s incentives.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n- If I play A0: opponent gets 2 (A0) or 3 (A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n- If I play A1: opponent gets 0 (A0) or 1 (A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n\nSo **A1 is also strictly dominant for the opponent**.\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), yielding (1,1).\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist: **reputation matters**.\n\nWe are told:\n> Reputation:  \n> deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT) played A0 in 0/40 rounds (0.00%)  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/40 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis means **both players so far have never played A0**. So the reputation is that both are \"always A1\" players.\n\nIf we continue playing A1 with 100% probability, we maintain this reputation, and the outcome remains (A1, A1) \u2192 1 point per round.\n\nBut is there a way to get more?\n\nSuppose we try to **cooperate** by occasionally playing A0 to try to get the (2,2) outcome.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: if I play A0, and opponent plays A1 (which they are very likely to, given their history), I get 0 \u2014 which is worse than 1.\n\nSo if opponent is playing A1 with 100% probability, then:\n\n- My expected payoff if I play A0: 0\n- My expected payoff if I play A1: 1\n\nSo I\u2019m better off playing A1.\n\nEven if opponent plays A1 with 99% probability, and A0 with 1%, then:\n\n- E[A0] = 0.99 * 0 + 0.01 * 2 = 0.02\n- E[A1] = 0.99 * 1 + 0.01 * 1 = 1.00\n\nStill better to play A1.\n\nIn fact, unless the opponent plays A0 with probability > 1/3, A1 is still better.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the threshold:\n\nLet p = probability opponent plays A0.\n\nThen my expected payoff:\n\n- E[A0] = p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n- E[A1] = p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo E[A1] - E[A0] = (2p + 1) - 2p = 1 > 0\n\n**Always**! No matter what p is, E[A1] = E[A0] + 1.\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0** for me, regardless of opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\nTherefore, **no matter what the opponent does, I should always play A1**.\n\nEven if the opponent is also rational and playing A1, we get 1 point \u2014 which is the best I can guarantee.\n\nTrying to play A0 to \"cooperate\" only risks getting 0, and doesn\u2019t improve my payoff.\n\nAlso, reputation is already at 0% A0 \u2014 so if I start playing A0, I might be seen as \"unpredictable\" or \"cooperative\", but since cooperation doesn\u2019t help me (because opponent won\u2019t reciprocate \u2014 they have no incentive to play A0), it\u2019s not worth it.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimal strategy is to play A1 with 100% probability.\n\nThis maximizes my expected payoff regardless of opponent\u2019s behavior, and maintains consistency with the current reputation (which is already all A1).\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": ""}], [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix for **me** (the player) is:\n\n- (A0, A0): 2 points\n- (A0, A1): 0 points\n- (A1, A0): 3 points\n- (A1, A1): 1 point\n\nThis is a classic 2x2 game.

The payoff matrix is:\n\n- (A0, A0): (2, 2)\n- (A0, A1): (0, 3)\n- (A1, A0): (3, 0)\n- (A1, A1): (1, 1)\n\nThis is a classic 2-player, 2-action game. It resembles a \"Chicken\" or \"Battle of the Sexes\" type game, but let\u2019s analyze it as a normal-form game to find the Nash equilibrium.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Payoff Matrix\n\nYour payoffs:\n- If you play A0: \n  - Opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2\n  - Opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0\n- If you play A1:\n  - Opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 3\n  - Opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nSo, if opponent plays A0, you prefer A1 (3 > 2).\nIf opponent plays A1, you prefer A1 (1 > 0).\n\nWait \u2014 that suggests A1 is a dominant strategy?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\n- If opponent plays A0: A1 gives 3, A0 gives 2 \u2192 prefer A1\n- If opponent plays A1: A1 gives 1, A0 gives 0 \u2192 prefer A1\n\nSo **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy** for you!\n\nSimilarly, for the opponent:\n- If you play A0: opponent gets 2 (if A0) or 3 (if A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n- If you play A1: opponent gets 0 (if A0) or 1 (if A1) \u2192 prefers A1\n\nSo **A1 is also a strictly dominant strategy for the opponent**.\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoff (1,1).\n\n### Step 2: But wait \u2014 what about reputation?\n\nThe reputation data shows:\n- openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT): played A0 in 0/45 \u2192 0% A0\n- qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT): played A0 in 0/45 \u2192 0% A0\n\nSo both you and the opponent have *never* played A0 in the last 45 rounds.\n\nThis suggests that the opponent is also playing A1 with 100% probability.\n\nIf the opponent is playing A1 with probability 1, then your best response is to play A1 (since 1 > 0).\n\nSo even if we didn\u2019t know the game theory, the empirical data shows the opponent is playing A1 always.\n\n### Step 3: What should you do?\n\n- Game theory says: A1 is dominant \u2192 play A1\n- Empirical data says: opponent plays A1 100% of the time \u2192 best response is A1\n- Playing A0 would give you 0 points (since opponent always plays A1)\n- Playing A1 gives you 1 point \u2014 which is better than 0\n\nSo you should play A1 with 100% probability.\n\n### Step 4: Format the output\n\nWe must output a JSON with A0 and A1 as keys, values as integers from 0 to 100 summing to 100.\n\nSince A1 is optimal, we assign:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n\nThis maximizes your expected payoff given both game theory and observed behavior.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from your perspective):\n\n| You \\ Opponent | A0      | A1      |\n|----------------|---------|---------|\n| A0             | 2, 2    | 0, 3    |\n| A1             | 3, 0    | 1, 1    |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (as integers between 0 and 100 that sum to 100).\n\nFirst, note that this is similar to a \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game. The Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies can be found.\n\nLet:\n- p = probability that you choose A0\n- q = probability that opponent chooses A0 (we don't control this, but we reason about it)\n\nYour expected payoff if you choose:\n- A0: 2*q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\n- A1: 3*q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSo the expected payoff for you when you play mixed strategy p (for A0) is:\nU(p, q) = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [2q + 1] = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p = 2q + 1 - p\n\nBut to find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we need to make the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n\nFrom the opponent's perspective (symmetrical game):\nIf opponent chooses A0: gets 2*p + 0*(1-p) = 2p\nIf opponent chooses A1: gets 3*p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nTo make opponent indifferent, set:\n2p = 2p + 1  --> This has no solution? Wait, that would imply 0=1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, I made a mistake: actually for the opponent:\n- If opponent plays A0: gets 2 when you play A0, and 0 when you play A1 -> so expected payoff: 2*p + 0*(1-p) = 2p\n- If opponent plays A1: gets 3 when you play A0, and 1 when you play A1 -> so expected payoff: 3*p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSo indeed, for any p, playing A1 always gives 1 more than playing A0. Therefore, the opponent strictly prefers A1 regardless of what you do. Similarly, from your perspective, if you compute:\n\nYour expected payoff if you play:\nA0: 2*q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\nA1: 3*q + 1*(1-q) = 2q + 1\n\nSo for any q, playing A1 gives exactly 1 more than playing A0. Therefore, you strictly prefer A1.\n\nThis means that the only Nash equilibrium is both players playing A1 with probability 1 (i.e., pure strategy A1). In that case, both get 1.\n\nBut is there a mixed strategy? Actually no, because as above, A1 strictly dominates A0: no matter what the opponent does, you get 1 more by playing A1 than A0. So you should always play A1.\n\nHowever, let's check the payoffs:\n- If you play A0 vs A0: you get 2\n- If you play A0 vs A1: you get 0\n- If you play A1 vs A0: you get 3\n- If you play A1 vs A1: you get 1\n\nSo indeed, if you compare:\nA1 vs A0: 3 > 2 (so better than A0 vs A0)\nA1 vs A1: 1 > 0 (so better than A0 vs A1)\n\nTherefore, A1 is strictly dominant. Similarly for the opponent.\n\nSo the rational choice is to always play A1.\n\nNow, looking at the reputation:\n- Both players have played A0 0/45 times (0%) in the past. This means both have always played A1.\n\nSo the history confirms that both are rational and always play A1.\n\nTherefore, to maximize your score, you should play A1 with probability 100.\n\nThus, the probability distribution should be: A0: 0, A1: 100.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nWe are playing a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nThe payoff matrix is:\n\n- (A0, A0): (2, 2)\n- (A0, A1): (0, 3)\n- (A1, A0): (3, 0)\n- (A1, A1): (1, 1)\n\nThis is a classic **coordination game with conflict**, similar to \"Chicken\" or a variant of Battle of the Sexes.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the game from a game-theoretic perspective.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify Nash Equilibria\n\nWe look for pure strategy Nash equilibria first.\n\n- If opponent plays A0:\n  - My payoff for A0: 2\n  - My payoff for A1: 3 \u2192 I prefer A1\n- If opponent plays A1:\n  - My payoff for A0: 0\n  - My payoff for A1: 1 \u2192 I prefer A1\n\nSo if opponent plays A0, I want to play A1.\nIf opponent plays A1, I want to play A1.\n\nWait \u2014 that suggests A1 is a dominant strategy?\n\nLet me check:\n\nMy payoffs:\n\n| My Action | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| A0        | 2           | 0           |\n| A1        | 3           | 1           |\n\nCompare A1 vs A0:\n\n- Against A0: 3 > 2 \u2192 A1 better\n- Against A1: 1 > 0 \u2192 A1 better\n\n**So A1 strictly dominates A0 for me.**\n\nSimilarly, for the opponent:\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\n| Opponent Action | My A0 | My A1 |\n|-----------------|-------|-------|\n| A0              | 2     | 0     |\n| A1              | 3     | 1     |\n\nSame structure: A1 gives 3 > 2 against A0, and 1 > 0 against A1 \u2192 **A1 strictly dominates A0 for opponent too.**\n\nTherefore, **(A1, A1)** is the **unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium**, and **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy** for both players.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: What does this mean for our strategy?\n\nSince A1 strictly dominates A0, no matter what the opponent does, playing A1 gives a higher or equal payoff.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s strictly better in both cases.\n\nSo rational self-interest dictates we should play A1 with probability 100%.\n\nBut wait \u2014 let\u2019s check the reputation data:\n\n> deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT) played A0 in 0/45 rounds (0.00%)  \n> qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT) played A0 in 0/45 rounds (0.00%)\n\nThis suggests that **both players have been playing A1 100% of the time so far**.\n\nThat\u2019s consistent with the dominant strategy.\n\nThere is no incentive to deviate.\n\nEven if we thought the opponent might be playing A0 sometimes (but they haven\u2019t, in 45 rounds!), we still have no reason to play A0, because A1 is always better.\n\nPlaying A0 would only make sense if we expected the opponent to play A0 with very high probability \u2014 but they haven\u2019t, and even then, A1 still gives 3 vs 2, so still better.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\n\nWe should play A1 with probability 100%, and A0 with 0%.\n\nThis maximizes our expected payoff regardless of opponent\u2019s behavior, and aligns with the observed behavior of the opponent (who has never played A0).\n\nAlso, deviating to play A0 would lower our payoff in every possible scenario.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}], [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\nThis is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (from your perspective):\n\n| You \\ Opponent | A0     | A1     |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| A0             | 2      | 0      |\n| A1             | 3      | 1      |\n\nWe are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.

Similarly, we can compute the opponent's expected payoff:\n\nOpponent's expected payoff:\nE_opp = q * [p*2 + (1-p)*0] + (1-q) * [p*3 + (1-p)*1]\n      = q * [2p] + (1-q) * [3p + 1 - p]\n      = 2pq + (1-q)(2p + 1)\n      = 2pq + 2p + 1 - 2pq - q\n      = 2p + 1 - q\n\nSo, the opponent's payoff is 2p + 1 - q. To maximize their payoff, they want to minimize q (since it has a negative coefficient) and hope that p is high.\n\nNow, we are in a situation where:\n- We want to set p low to maximize our payoff (which depends on q).\n- The opponent wants to set q low to maximize their payoff (which depends on p).\n\nThis is a classic \"chicken\" game. There is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium can be found by making each player indifferent.\n\nTo find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:\nSet the opponent's q such that we are indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nOur payoff if we choose A0 (pure): E(A0) = 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\nOur payoff if we choose A1 (pure): E(A1) = 3q + 1*(1-q) = 2q + 1\n\nSet them equal for indifference: 2q = 2q + 1? This is impossible. Actually, wait:\n\nActually, we should set the opponent's q so that our expected payoff from A0 equals that from A1:\n2q = 3q + 1 - q? That doesn't work.\n\nBetter: For us to be indifferent between A0 and A1, the expected payoff from A0 should equal that from A1.\nE(A0) = 2q\nE(A1) = 3q + 1*(1-q) = 2q + 1\n\nSet equal: 2q = 2q + 1 -> 0=1, which is impossible. This means there is no mixed strategy that makes us indifferent. Actually, we always prefer A1 over A0 because:\nE(A1) - E(A0) = (2q+1) - 2q = 1 > 0.\nSo, no matter what q is, we always get a higher payoff by choosing A1. Therefore, we should always choose A1.\n\nSimilarly, for the opponent: they always prefer A1 over A0 because:\nE_opp(A0) = 2p\nE_opp(A1) = 3p + 1*(1-p) = 2p+1\nSo, E_opp(A1) - E_opp(A0) = 1 > 0.\n\nTherefore, both players have a dominant strategy: always choose A1.\n\nSo the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoff (1,1).\n\nGiven that, we should choose A1 with probability 100%.\n\nAlso, looking at the reputation:\n- Both players have played A0 in 0/45 rounds (0%), meaning they always choose A1. This reinforces that the opponent is likely to choose A1.\n\nTherefore, we should choose A1 with 100% probability.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100}"}]]
