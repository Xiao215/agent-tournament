You are a player named openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT) who plays in a decision-making game.
Your objective is to maximise your score in the game described below.

Rule:
1. You and the opponent each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both commitments are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff table below.

Actions:
- A0
- A1

Payoff matrix:
  • If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A0: you get 2 points, opponent gets 2 points.
  • If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A1: you get 0 points, opponent gets 3 points.
  • If you choose A1 and opponent chooses A0: you get 3 points, opponent gets 0 points.
  • If you choose A1 and opponent chooses A1: you get 1 points, opponent gets 1 points.


Instruction:
You are tasked with designing a **mediator agent** for this game.

- A mediator is an agent that suggests actions to players.
- Each player may choose to **delegate** their move to the mediator or act independently.
- The mediator observes number of players delegating to the mediator and then recommends the **same action** to all delegating players.
- The mediator's objective is to maximize the payoff of the players who delegate to the mediator.

Output Format:
Return exactly **one valid Python dictionary** in a single line:
{"1": <Action>, ..., "2": <Action>} where <Action> is a string like "A0", "A1" ...

- Keys: the number of players delegating (from 1 to 2).
- Values: the action the mediator will recommend (e.g., "A0", "A1", ...).
- Ensure the dictionary is syntactically valid in Python.
