No! If both played A0, they\u2019d get 2 each. But neither can trust the other to play A0, because A1 gives a higher payoff regardless.\n\nSo we\u2019re stuck in a **Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma-like** situation: (A0,A0) is Pareto superior, but (A1,A1) is the only Nash equilibrium.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Introduce the Mediator Option (A2)\n\nNow we have a third action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**\n\nThe mediator\u2019s behavior depends on **how many players delegate**:\n\n- If **1 player** delegates \u2192 mediator recommends **A1**\n- If **2 players** delegate \u2192 mediator recommends **A0**\n\nWe are one of the two players. We must choose a mixed strategy over {A0, A1, A2}.\n\nWe need to compute the best mixed strategy for **ourselves**, anticipating the opponent\u2019s strategy (which we assume is rational and symmetric, or at least we must consider best responses).\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- You choose: A0 with prob `p`, A1 with prob `q`, A2 with prob `r`, where `p + q + r = 1`\n\nBut the mediator\u2019s action depends on **how many players** delegate. Since there are only two players, we must consider the **joint strategy**.\n\nWe need to think about **symmetric equilibrium** \u2014 both players use the same strategy.\n\nAssume both players use the same mixed strategy: (p, q, r) over (A0, A1, A2)\n\nWe want to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the possible cases based on how many players delegate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze mediator outcomes based on delegation\n\nThere are 4 possible delegation scenarios (since two players):\n\n| You delegate? | Opponent delegates? | Mediator recommendation to each | Outcome (your action) |\n|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| No            | No                  | None                             | You play your chosen action (A0 or A1) |\n| No            | Yes                 | Mediator recommends A1 to opponent | You play A0/A1; opponent plays A1 |\n| Yes           | No                  | Mediator recommends A1 to you     | You play A1; opponent plays A0/A1 |\n| Yes           | Yes                 | Mediator recommends A0 to both    | You play A0; opponent plays A0 |\n\nNote: If you delegate, you **follow** the mediator\u2019s recommendation. So if you choose A2, your action becomes whatever the mediator says.\n\nSo your **actual action** depends on:\n\n- Whether you delegated\n- Whether opponent delegated\n- The mediator\u2019s rule\n\nWe need to compute your **expected payoff** for each of your pure strategies (A0, A1, A2), given opponent plays (p, q, r).\n\nLet\u2019s compute expected payoff for **you** if you choose:\n\n---\n\n#### Case 1: You choose A0 (independently)\n\nThen your action is A0.\n\nOpponent\u2019s action depends on their strategy:\n\n- With prob p: opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2\n- With prob q: opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0\n- With prob r: opponent delegates \u2192 mediator\u2019s action depends on **how many** delegated.\n\nWait \u2014 if opponent delegates, then **only one** player (opponent) delegated \u2192 mediator recommends A1 to opponent \u2192 opponent plays A1.\n\nSo if you play A0, and opponent delegates \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0.\n\nSo overall:\n\nYour payoff if you play A0:\n= p * 2 + q * 0 + r * 0 = **2p**\n\n---\n\n#### Case 2: You choose A1 (independently)\n\nYour action is A1.\n\nOpponent:\n\n- p: plays A0 \u2192 you get 3\n- q: plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n- r: delegates \u2192 opponent plays A1 (since only one delegator) \u2192 you get 1\n\nSo payoff:\n= p * 3 + q * 1 + r * 1 = **3p + q + r**\n\nBut since p + q + r = 1 \u2192 q + r = 1 - p\n\nSo: 3p + (1 - p) = **2p + 1**\n\n---\n\n#### Case 3: You choose A2 (delegate)\n\nThen your action is determined by the mediator.\n\nMediator\u2019s recommendation depends on **how many** players delegated.\n\n- If opponent does **not** delegate (prob p + q): then only you delegated \u2192 1 delegator \u2192 mediator recommends **A1** \u2192 you play A1 \u2192 your payoff depends on opponent\u2019s action.\n\nWait \u2014 we need to compute **expected payoff** when you delegate.\n\nSo if you delegate (choose A2), your action becomes:\n\n- If opponent **does not** delegate (prob = p + q): then only you delegated \u2192 mediator gives you A1 \u2192 you play A1\n\n  Then opponent plays:\n  - A0 with prob p \u2192 you get 3\n  - A1 with prob q \u2192 you get 1\n  - So expected payoff = p*3 + q*1\n\n- If opponent **does** delegate (prob r): then both delegated \u2192 mediator gives both A0 \u2192 you play A0\n\n  Then opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2\n\nSo total expected payoff if you choose A2:\n\n= (p + q) * (3p + q) + r * 2\n\nWait \u2014 no. Let\u2019s be precise.\n\nWhen you delegate, your action is determined by the mediator, which depends on **total number of delegators**.\n\nSo:\n\n- With probability (p + q): opponent does **not** delegate \u2192 total delegators = 1 \u2192 you get A1\n\n  Then opponent\u2019s action is:\n  - A0 with probability p / (p+q) ? No \u2014 we need to be careful.\n\nActually, opponent\u2019s strategy is fixed: they choose A0 with prob p, A1 with q, A2 with r.\n\nSo if you choose A2 (delegate), then:\n\n- Probability opponent does **not** delegate = p + q \u2192 then you get A1 from mediator\n\n  Then opponent\u2019s action is:\n  - A0 with probability p / (p+q)? No \u2014 we don\u2019t condition. We need joint probability.\n\nBetter: use law of total expectation.\n\nYour payoff when you delegate:\n\n= P(opponent does not delegate) * E[payoff | you=A1, opponent\u2019s action]  \n+ P(opponent delegates) * E[payoff | you=A0, opponent=A0]\n\nBecause:\n\n- If opponent does not delegate \u2192 you play A1 (from mediator), opponent plays A0 with prob p, A1 with prob q \u2192 so:\n\n  E[payoff | you=A1, opponent not delegate] = p * 3 + q * 1\n\n- If opponent delegates \u2192 both delegate \u2192 mediator gives both A0 \u2192 you play A0, opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2\n\nSo:\n\nPayoff if you choose A2:\n\n= (p + q) * (3p + q) + r * 2\n\nWait \u2014 no! That\u2019s wrong.\n\n(p + q) is the probability opponent does not delegate.\n\nBut when opponent does not delegate, their action is A0 with probability p, A1 with probability q \u2014 **not** conditional.\n\nSo:\n\nE[payoff | you delegate] =  \nP(opponent plays A0) * [if you get A1 \u2192 payoff=3]  \n+ P(opponent plays A1) * [if you get A1 \u2192 payoff=1]  \n+ P(opponent delegates) * [if you get A0 \u2192 payoff=2]\n\nSo:\n\n= p * 3 + q * 1 + r * 2\n\nBecause:\n\n- If opponent plays A0 (prob p): you get A1 \u2192 payoff=3\n- If opponent plays A1 (prob q): you get A1 \u2192 payoff=1\n- If opponent delegates (prob r): you get A0 \u2192 payoff=2\n\nSo **regardless of what opponent does**, when you delegate, your payoff is:\n\n**3p + 1q + 2r**\n\nThat\u2019s clean!\n\nSo summary of expected payoffs for you, given opponent plays (p, q, r):\n\n| Your Action | Expected Payoff |\n|-------------|-----------------|\n| A0          | 2p              |\n| A1          | 3p + q + r = 2p + 1 (since q + r = 1 - p) |\n| A2          | 3p + q + 2r     |\n\nNote: 3p + q + 2r = 3p + q + 2(1 - p - q) = 3p + q + 2 - 2p - 2q = p - q + 2\n\nSo:\n\n- A0: 2p\n- A1: 2p + 1\n- A2: p - q + 2\n\nWe are looking for a symmetric Nash equilibrium: both players use same (p, q, r)\n\nWe want to find (p, q, r) such that no player wants to deviate.\n\nNote: A1 always gives 2p + 1, which is **always greater than A0\u2019s 2p** (by 1), so **A0 is strictly dominated by A1** in this setup too.\n\nSo in any equilibrium, p = 0.\n\nBecause if p > 0, then A1 gives strictly more than A0, so you\u2019d never play A0.\n\nSo set p = 0.\n\nThen:\n\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 1\n- A2: 0 - q + 2 = 2 - q\n\nBut since p = 0, then q + r = 1 \u2192 q = 1 - r\n\nSo A2 payoff = 2 - (1 - r) = 1 + r\n\nSo now:\n\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 1\n- A2: 1 + r\n\nWe want to find r such that the player is indifferent or best-responding.\n\nNote: A2 gives 1 + r, A1 gives 1.\n\nSo A2 gives **more** than A1 if r > 0.\n\nSo if r > 0, then A2 > A1 \u2192 you\u2019d prefer A2.\n\nBut if you choose A2, then r > 0, which increases the payoff of A2 \u2192 it\u2019s self-reinforcing.\n\nWait \u2014 but r is your probability of choosing A2.\n\nIn symmetric equilibrium, both players choose r.\n\nSo if both choose r > 0, then both delegate \u2192 mediator gives A0 to both \u2192 you get 2.\n\nWait \u2014 hold on! There\u2019s a mistake.\n\nEarlier we computed:\n\nIf you choose A2, your payoff = 3p + q + 2r\n\nWith p=0, this becomes q + 2r\n\nBut q = 1 - r \u2192 so payoff = (1 - r) + 2r = 1 + r\n\nBut this is **only** if the opponent\u2019s action is independent of your choice.\n\nBut when you choose A2, and opponent chooses A2, then **both** delegate \u2192 mediator gives **A0** to both \u2192 so you get 2.\n\nBut in our formula, we have:\n\nPayoff if you delegate = 3p + q + 2r\n\nBut when opponent delegates (prob r), you get 2 \u2014 correct.\n\nWhen opponent plays A0 (p), you get 3 \u2014 correct.\n\nWhen opponent plays A1 (q), you get 1 \u2014 correct.\n\nSo formula is correct.\n\nBut if **both** players play A2 (r=1), then:\n\nYour payoff = 3*0 + 0 + 2*1 = 2\n\nBut if you deviate to A1, and opponent plays A2 \u2192 opponent plays A0 (because both delegated) \u2192 so you play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 3.\n\nWait \u2014 this is critical!\n\nIf **both** players play A2, then mediator gives A0 to both \u2192 so both play A0 \u2192 you get 2.\n\nBut if you **deviate** to A1 (and opponent still plays A2), then:\n\n- You play A1 (independently)\n- Opponent delegated \u2192 so opponent plays A0 (because both delegated? Wait \u2014 no!)\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s the key point:\n\nThe mediator\u2019s recommendation depends on **how many players delegated** at the time of decision.\n\nSo if **you** choose A2 (delegate), and **opponent** chooses A2 (delegate), then **two** players delegated \u2192 mediator recommends A0 to both \u2192 so both play A0.\n\nBut if **you** choose A1 (don\u2019t delegate), and **opponent** chooses A2 (delegates), then **only one** player delegated \u2192 mediator recommends A1 to opponent \u2192 opponent plays A1.\n\nSo your action is A1, opponent\u2019s is A1 \u2192 you get 1.\n\nSo let\u2019s recast the payoff for A2 **correctly**.\n\nWe need to compute: if you choose A2, what is your expected payoff, given opponent\u2019s mixed strategy (p, q, r)?\n\nYour action under A2 is determined by mediator:\n\n- If opponent does **not** delegate (prob p + q): then only you delegated \u2192 mediator gives you A1 \u2192 your action = A1\n\n  Then opponent\u2019s action is:\n  - A0 with prob p / (p+q)? No \u2014 we need unconditional.\n\nActually, the opponent\u2019s action is chosen independently.\n\nSo:\n\n- With probability p: opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get A1 \u2192 payoff = 3\n- With probability q: opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get A1 \u2192 payoff = 1\n- With probability r: opponent plays A2 \u2192 both delegated \u2192 mediator gives you A0 \u2192 you play A0 \u2192 opponent plays A0 \u2192 payoff = 2\n\nSo yes, your payoff if you choose A2 is:\n\n= p * 3 + q * 1 + r * 2\n\nThat is correct.\n\nNow, if both players play r = 1 (both always delegate), then:\n\nYour payoff if you play A2: p=0, q=0, r=1 \u2192 payoff = 0 + 0 + 2*1 = 2\n\nBut if you **deviate** to A1 (and opponent still plays A2), then:\n\n- You play A1\n- Opponent delegated \u2192 so opponent plays A0 (because only one delegator? No \u2014 opponent delegated, but you didn\u2019t \u2192 so only one delegator \u2192 mediator gives A1 to opponent \u2192 opponent plays A1)\n\nWait \u2014 if you play A1 (don\u2019t delegate), opponent plays A2 (delegates) \u2192 then only **one** player delegated \u2192 mediator gives A1 to opponent \u2192 opponent plays A1\n\nYou play A1 \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nSo if you deviate from A2 to A1 when opponent plays A2, your payoff drops from 2 to 1 \u2192 so you **don\u2019t** want to deviate.\n\nSimilarly, if you deviate to A0: you play A0, opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0 \u2192 worse.\n\nSo if both play A2, then payoff is 2, and deviation gives less \u2192 so (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium!\n\nNow, what if both play A1? Payoff = 1 each.\n\nIf you deviate to A2: then you delegate, opponent plays A1 \u2192 only one delegator? No \u2014 you delegated, opponent didn\u2019t \u2192 so one delegator \u2192 mediator gives you A1 \u2192 you play A1, opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1 \u2192 same as before.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nBut if you deviate to A0: you get 0 \u2192 worse.\n\nSo (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium, but with lower payoff.\n\nNow, what if both play A2? Payoff = 2 \u2014 better!\n\nIs there a mixed strategy equilibrium?\n\nSuppose both play A2 with probability r, and A1 with probability 1-r (p=0)\n\nThen your payoff for:\n\n- A1: 2p + 1 = 1\n- A2: 3p + q + 2r = 0 + (1 - r) + 2r = 1 + r\n\nSo A2 gives 1 + r, A1 gives 1.\n\nSo if r > 0, A2 > A1 \u2192 so you prefer A2.\n\nIf r = 0, A2 gives 1, same as A1.\n\nSo the only symmetric equilibrium is:\n\n- r = 1 \u2192 both play A2 \u2192 both get 2\n\nBecause if r < 1, then A2 gives more than A1, so you\u2019d increase r.\n\nThus, the **unique symmetric Nash equilibrium** is both players play A2 with probability 1.\n\nThis yields payoff 2 for each \u2014 which is the **Pareto optimal** outcome!\n\nBy using the mediator, they coordinate on (A0, A0) even though it\u2019s not a Nash equilibrium without delegation.\n\nThis is a classic use of a **correlated equilibrium** via a mediator.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nWe are to output a probability distribution over A0, A1, A2 as integers from 0 to 100 summing to 100.\n\nIn equilibrium, we should play A2 with probability 1 \u2192 100%.\n\nSo:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0, \"A2\": 100}\n\nThis is the optimal strategy.\n\nEven if opponent doesn\u2019t play A2, if we play A2, we still get at least 1 (if opponent plays A1) or 2 (if opponent also plays A2), and if opponent plays A0, we get 3 \u2014 so it\u2019s never worse than A1, and often better.\n\nAnd since A2 dominates A1 and A0 in expectation when opponent is rational, we should always delegate.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0, \"A2\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 2, "response": "{\"A0\":0, \"A1\":0, \"A2\":100}"}]}, {"mediator": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "moves": [{"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's think through this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)\n\nWe have two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nPayoff matrix (for **you**):\n\n| You \\ Opponent | A0     | A1     |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| **A0**         | 2      | 0      |\n| **A1**         | 3      | 1      |\n\nThis is a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with no dominant strategy.\n\nLet\u2019s find the **Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies** for the base game (ignoring delegation for now).\n\nLet:\n- You play A0 with probability `p`, A1 with probability `1-p`\n- Opponent plays A0 with probability `q`, A1 with probability `1-q`\n\nYou want to choose `p` such that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff for playing A0:\n= p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff for playing A1:\n= p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nSet them equal for indifference:\n2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 **Impossible**\n\nWait \u2014 that suggests the opponent **always prefers A1**, because 2p + 1 > 2p for all p.\n\nLet\u2019s check your payoffs from the opponent\u2019s perspective.\n\nActually, let\u2019s compute the **best response** from your side.\n\nSuppose opponent plays A0 with probability q, A1 with 1-q.\n\nYour expected payoff for playing A0:  \n= q * 2 + (1-q) * 0 = 2q\n\nYour expected payoff for playing A1:  \n= q * 3 + (1-q) * 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\nSo:  \nEU(A1) = 2q + 1  \nEU(A0) = 2q  \n\nSo **EU(A1) > EU(A0)** for all q \u2208 [0,1]\n\n\u2192 **A1 strictly dominates A0** for you!\n\nSo no matter what the opponent does, you are always better off playing A1.\n\nSimilarly, let\u2019s check from opponent\u2019s perspective.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff:\n\nIf you play A0 (prob p), A1 (prob 1-p)\n\nOpponent\u2019s EU(A0) = p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p  \nOpponent\u2019s EU(A1) = p * 3 + (1-p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1\n\nAgain, EU(A1) = 2p + 1 > 2p = EU(A0) \u2192 So **A1 strictly dominates A0** for opponent too.\n\nSo in the base game, **(A1, A1)** is the unique Nash equilibrium, with payoff (1,1).\n\nBut wait \u2014 is that the best possible? No! (A0,A0) gives (2,2), which is better for both. But it\u2019s not stable because each has incentive to deviate to A1 for 3 points.\n\nSo the game is a **Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma** variant!\n\n- (A0,A0): (2,2) \u2014 mutual cooperation (Pareto optimal)\n- (A1,A1): (1,1) \u2014 mutual defection (Nash)\n- (A0,A1) or (A1,A0): (0,3) or (3,0) \u2014 temptation and sucker\n\nSo the dilemma: if both cooperate (A0), both get 2. But each can get 3 by defecting (A1) if the other cooperates. But if both defect, both get only 1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Introduce the mediator option (A2)\n\nNow we have a third action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**\n\nThe mediator\u2019s behavior depends on **how many players delegate**:\n\n- If **1 player** delegates \u2192 mediator recommends **A1**\n- If **2 players** delegate \u2192 mediator recommends **A0**\n\nYou can choose to:\n- Play A0 (prob p0)\n- Play A1 (prob p1)\n- Delegate to mediator (prob p2)\n\nWith p0 + p1 + p2 = 100 (as per integer percentage requirement)\n\nWe need to find the optimal mixed strategy over {A0, A1, A2} to maximize your expected payoff, assuming the opponent is also rational and will do the same.\n\nThis becomes a **symmetric game** with 3 actions.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the mediator\u2019s effect.\n\n#### Case 1: You delegate (A2), opponent does not\n\n\u2192 Only you delegate \u2192 mediator recommends A1 \u2192 you play A1  \nOpponent plays their chosen action (say, A0 or A1)\n\nSo your payoff:\n- If opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 3 (since you played A1)\n- If opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nBut you don\u2019t control opponent\u2019s action.\n\n#### Case 2: You delegate, opponent also delegates\n\n\u2192 Both delegate \u2192 mediator recommends A0 \u2192 you play A0  \nOpponent also plays A0 (because mediator recommends A0 to both)\n\n\u2192 So both play A0 \u2192 you get 2 points.\n\nThis is **excellent!** You get 2, which is better than the Nash equilibrium (1) of the base game.\n\n#### Case 3: You don\u2019t delegate, opponent delegates\n\n\u2192 Opponent delegates \u2192 mediator recommends A1 \u2192 opponent plays A1  \nYou play your chosen action (A0 or A1)\n\nIf you play A0 \u2192 you get 0  \nIf you play A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nSo you\u2019d prefer to play A1 \u2192 get 1 instead of 0.\n\n#### Case 4: Neither delegates \u2192 base game \u2192 both play A1 (Nash) \u2192 you get 1\n\nSo the key insight:\n\n> **If both players delegate, they both get 2 \u2014 the Pareto optimal outcome!**\n\nThis is the only way to achieve (2,2) in a non-cooperative setting.\n\nBut can we rely on both delegating?\n\nSuppose you think the opponent will delegate with probability q.\n\nThen your expected payoff for each action:\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute expected payoffs for each of your actions, given opponent\u2019s delegation probability q\n\nLet q = probability opponent delegates (A2)  \nThen (1-q) = probability opponent plays A0 or A1 (we\u2019ll need to model their strategy too)\n\nBut we are assuming symmetry and rationality. So we can assume opponent uses same strategy as you.\n\nLet your strategy be:  \n- P(A0) = x  \n- P(A1) = y  \n- P(A2) = z  \nwith x + y + z = 100 (in integer percentages)\n\nWe need to find x, y, z that maximize your expected payoff, assuming opponent uses same strategy.\n\nLet\u2019s compute your **expected payoff** as a function of x, y, z.\n\nWe\u2019ll compute E[payoff] = sum over all opponent actions * P(opponent action) * payoff(you, opponent)\n\nOpponent can choose A0, A1, or A2.\n\nWe need to compute the **joint probabilities** and resulting outcomes.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- P(opponent chooses A0) = x  \n- P(opponent chooses A1) = y  \n- P(opponent chooses A2) = z  \n\nNow, for each of your actions, compute expected payoff.\n\n---\n\n#### Case A: You choose A0\n\nThen your payoff depends on opponent:\n\n- Opponent A0 (prob x): you get 2  \n- Opponent A1 (prob y): you get 0  \n- Opponent A2 (prob z): opponent delegates \u2192 only one delegator \u2192 mediator recommends A1 \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0\n\nSo:  \nEU(A0) = x * 2 + y * 0 + z * 0 = 2x\n\n---\n\n#### Case B: You choose A1\n\n- Opponent A0 (prob x): you get 3  \n- Opponent A1 (prob y): you get 1  \n- Opponent A2 (prob z): opponent delegates \u2192 only one delegator \u2192 mediator recommends A1 \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nSo:  \nEU(A1) = x * 3 + y * 1 + z * 1 = 3x + y + z\n\nBut since x + y + z = 1, we can write:  \nEU(A1) = 3x + (y + z) = 3x + (1 - x) = 2x + 1\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s interesting!\n\nEU(A1) = 3x + y + z = 3x + (1 - x) = 2x + 1\n\nSo EU(A1) = 2x + 1\n\nEU(A0) = 2x\n\nSo again, **EU(A1) = EU(A0) + 1** \u2192 A1 always gives 1 more than A0, regardless of x.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t delegate, you always prefer A1.\n\n---\n\n#### Case C: You choose A2 (delegate)\n\nNow, your action is to delegate. The mediator will act based on **how many players delegate**.\n\nYou are delegating. So now we need to know: **what is the probability that the opponent also delegates?**\n\nThat\u2019s z (since opponent uses same strategy).\n\nSo:\n\n- With probability z: opponent also delegates \u2192 both delegate \u2192 mediator recommends A0 \u2192 you play A0 \u2192 you get 2  \n- With probability (1 - z): opponent does NOT delegate \u2192 only you delegate \u2192 mediator recommends A1 \u2192 you play A1 \u2192 your payoff depends on what opponent plays\n\nBut if opponent does not delegate, they play A0 with prob x, A1 with prob y.\n\nSo your payoff when you delegate and opponent does not delegate:\n\n= x * (you play A1, opponent plays A0) \u2192 payoff = 3  \n+ y * (you play A1, opponent plays A1) \u2192 payoff = 1\n\nSo:\n\nEU(A2) =  \nz * 2  +  (1 - z) * [x * 3 + y * 1]\n\nBut x + y = 1 - z, so:\n\nEU(A2) = 2z + (1 - z)(3x + y)\n\nWe can write 3x + y = 2x + (x + y) = 2x + (1 - z)\n\nSo:\n\nEU(A2) = 2z + (1 - z)(2x + 1 - z)\n\nLet\u2019s expand:\n\n= 2z + (1 - z)(2x + 1 - z)\n\nWe now have expressions for all three:\n\n- EU(A0) = 2x  \n- EU(A1) = 2x + 1  \n- EU(A2) = 2z + (1 - z)(2x + 1 - z)\n\nWe want to find x, y, z \u2265 0, x+y+z=1, that maximize your expected payoff.\n\nBut note: EU(A1) = 2x + 1 > 2x = EU(A0), so **A0 is strictly dominated by A1** in all cases.\n\nSo we can set x = 0. (Never play A0)\n\nThen y + z = 1 \u2192 y = 1 - z\n\nNow:\n\nEU(A0) = 0  \nEU(A1) = 2*0 + 1 = 1  \nEU(A2) = 2z + (1 - z)(2*0 + 1 - z) = 2z + (1 - z)(1 - z) = 2z + (1 - z)^2\n\nSimplify EU(A2):\n\n= 2z + (1 - 2z + z\u00b2) = 2z + 1 - 2z + z\u00b2 = 1 + z\u00b2\n\nSo:\n\n- If you play A1: payoff = 1  \n- If you play A2: payoff = 1 + z\u00b2\n\nSince z\u00b2 \u2265 0, **EU(A2) \u2265 1**, and strictly greater than 1 if z > 0.\n\nBut z is the probability that **opponent** delegates.\n\nWait \u2014 we are computing **your** expected payoff assuming opponent uses the same strategy.\n\nSo z is your own probability of delegating (since symmetric).\n\nSo if you choose to delegate with probability z, then your expected payoff from delegating is 1 + z\u00b2\n\nBut your overall expected payoff is:\n\nE[payoff] = x * EU(A0) + y * EU(A1) + z * EU(A2)  \nBut x=0, y=1-z, so:\n\nE = (1 - z) * 1 + z * (1 + z\u00b2)  \n= (1 - z) + z + z\u00b3  \n= 1 + z\u00b3\n\nSo total expected payoff = 1 + z\u00b3\n\nThis is **maximized when z is maximized**, i.e., z = 1\n\nThen E = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo the optimal strategy is: **z = 1, x = 0, y = 0**\n\nThat is: **Always delegate to the mediator**\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause if you always delegate (z=1), then opponent also always delegates (since symmetric), so both delegate \u2192 mediator recommends A0 \u2192 both play A0 \u2192 you get 2.\n\nAnd your expected payoff is 2.\n\nIf you ever play A1 (even with small probability), then z < 1, and E = 1 + z\u00b3 < 2.\n\nSo **the unique symmetric Nash equilibrium is to always delegate to the mediator**.\n\nThis is a brilliant coordination mechanism!\n\nBy delegating, you create a correlated equilibrium where both players end up playing A0, getting 2 each \u2014 the Pareto optimal outcome \u2014 without needing to communicate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Format\n\nWe need to output a JSON with integer percentages summing to 100.\n\nWe have:\n\n- A0: 0  \n- A1: 0  \n- A2: 100\n\nThis is valid: 0 + 0 + 100 = 100\n\nAnd it\u2019s optimal.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0, \"A2\": 100}"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100,\"A2\":0}"}]}]

That can\u2019t be right.\n\nWait \u2014 we need to compute **your** expected payoff, but for Nash equilibrium, we need to find a strategy where **each player is indifferent** to the other\u2019s strategy.\n\nActually, let\u2019s compute **your** best response to opponent\u2019s mixed strategy.\n\nLet opponent play A0 with probability `q`, A1 with `1-q`.\n\nYour expected payoff:\n- If you play A0: `2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q`\n- If you play A1: `3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1`\n\nSo your payoff for A1 is always **1 point higher** than A0, regardless of q.\n\n\u2192 **A1 strictly dominates A0** for you!\n\nBecause:\n- 2q + 1 > 2q for all q \u2208 [0,1]\n\nSo **no matter what the opponent does, you always get 1 more point by playing A1 than A0**.\n\nTherefore, **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy** for you.\n\nSimilarly, let\u2019s check for the opponent.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoffs:\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent Action | A0       | A1       |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**                        | 2        | 3        |\n| **A1**                        | 0        | 1        |\n\nOpponent\u2019s expected payoff:\n- If they play A0: `2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p`\n- If they play A1: `3p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1`\n\nAgain, A1 gives opponent 1 more point than A0, regardless of p.\n\n\u2192 So **A1 is strictly dominant for opponent too**.\n\nThus, the **unique Nash equilibrium** in the base game is **(A1, A1)**, yielding (1,1) for both.\n\nBut wait \u2014 that\u2019s a **Pareto inefficient** outcome! Because (A0,A0) gives (2,2), which is better for both.\n\nBut since A1 strictly dominates A0, rational players will both play A1.\n\nSo without mediator: **both play A1 with probability 1 \u2192 (A1:100, A0:0)**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Introduce the mediator option (A2)**\n\nNow we have a third action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**\n\nThe mediator\u2019s behavior:\n- If **1 player** delegates \u2192 mediator recommends **A1**\n- If **2 players** delegate \u2192 mediator recommends **A0**\n\nYou can choose to:\n- Play A0 (prob p0)\n- Play A1 (prob p1)\n- Delegate to mediator (prob p2)\n\nWith p0 + p1 + p2 = 100 (in integer percentages)\n\nWe need to find the optimal mixed strategy for **you**, anticipating that the **opponent is also rational** and may also consider delegation.\n\nThis becomes a **game with three actions per player**, and we must find a Nash equilibrium.\n\nLet\u2019s think strategically.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze mediator incentives**\n\nThe mediator\u2019s recommendation depends on **how many players delegate**.\n\nSo if **you** delegate, and **opponent does not**, then mediator recommends **A1** \u2192 you get 1 point (since opponent plays something \u2014 we don\u2019t know yet).\n\nBut if **both** delegate, mediator recommends **A0** \u2192 you get 2 points if opponent also plays A0 (but opponent\u2019s action depends on their own choice).\n\nWait \u2014 important clarification:\n\n> \"the mediator will recommend action A1/A0\" \u2014 does this mean the mediator **forces** you to play that action? Or just recommends?\n\nThe instruction says:  \n> \"the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.\"\n\nSo if you delegate, **you are not choosing your action** \u2014 the mediator chooses it for you.\n\nSo if you choose A2 (delegate), then:\n- If opponent also delegates \u2192 mediator plays A0 for you \u2192 you get payoff based on opponent\u2019s action.\n- If opponent does not delegate \u2192 mediator plays A1 for you \u2192 you get payoff based on opponent\u2019s action.\n\nSo your payoff when you delegate depends on **what the opponent does**.\n\nLet\u2019s define the possible outcomes.\n\nWe need to consider **all combinations** of your action and opponent\u2019s action (each can be A0, A1, A2).\n\nThere are 3x3 = 9 possible outcome pairs.\n\nLet\u2019s compute your expected payoff for each of your pure strategies, given opponent\u2019s mixed strategy.\n\nBut since both players are symmetric and rational, we can look for a symmetric Nash equilibrium.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose both players use the same mixed strategy: (p0, p1, p2) for (A0, A1, A2)\n\nWe want to find p0, p1, p2 such that no player can benefit by unilaterally deviating.\n\nLet\u2019s consider possible symmetric equilibria.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Consider possible symmetric equilibria**\n\n#### **Candidate 1: Both play A1 (p1=100)**\n\nThen you get 1 point.\n\nCan you benefit by switching to A2?\n\nIf you switch to A2 (delegate), and opponent plays A1 (not delegating), then since only **you** delegated \u2192 mediator plays A1 for you.\n\nSo you play A1, opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1 point. Same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nWhat if you switch to A0?\n\nYou play A0, opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0 points \u2192 worse.\n\nSo no incentive to deviate.\n\nBut is this the best? No \u2014 because (A0,A0) gives 2 each, which is better.\n\nBut you can\u2019t get there unless both play A0 \u2014 but A1 dominates A0.\n\nSo (A1,A1) is Nash, but inefficient.\n\n#### **Candidate 2: Both play A2 (delegate)**\n\nThen both delegate \u2192 mediator plays A0 for both \u2192 you get 2 points.\n\nIs this better than A1? Yes! 2 > 1.\n\nCan you benefit by deviating?\n\nSuppose you unilaterally switch to A0 (while opponent delegates \u2192 mediator plays A0 for them).\n\nThen:\n- You play A0\n- Opponent plays A0 (via mediator)\n\n\u2192 You get 2 points (same as before)\n\nNo gain.\n\nWhat if you switch to A1?\n\nYou play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 3 points!\n\nOh! **Big gain!**\n\nSo if opponent delegates (so mediator plays A0 for them), and you play A1, you get 3 points.\n\nThat\u2019s better than 2.\n\nSo **if both are delegating**, you have a strong incentive to **deviate to A1** and get 3 instead of 2.\n\nTherefore, **(A2, A2) is NOT a Nash equilibrium**.\n\n#### **Candidate 3: Both play A0**\n\nThen you get 2 points.\n\nCan you benefit by switching?\n\n- Switch to A1: opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 3 \u2192 better! So you will deviate.\n\nSo (A0,A0) is not Nash.\n\n#### **Candidate 4: One player delegates, other plays A1**\n\nSuppose opponent plays A1 (not delegating).\n\nYou consider delegating.\n\nIf you delegate \u2192 only you delegate \u2192 mediator plays A1 for you.\n\nSo you play A1, opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1.\n\nBut if you had played A1 directly, you also get 1.\n\nSame payoff.\n\nIf you play A0 \u2192 you get 0.\n\nSo no incentive to delegate.\n\nNow suppose opponent plays A0.\n\nYou consider delegating.\n\nIf you delegate \u2192 only you delegate \u2192 mediator plays A1 for you.\n\nYou play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 3.\n\nIf you had played A1 directly \u2192 you also get 3.\n\nSame.\n\nIf you play A0 \u2192 you get 2.\n\nSo again, no incentive to delegate \u2014 you\u2019re better off playing A1 directly.\n\nSo delegation doesn\u2019t help if opponent plays A0 or A1.\n\nBut what if opponent plays A2?\n\nSuppose opponent delegates \u2192 mediator plays A0 for them.\n\nThen:\n\n- If you play A0 \u2192 you get 2\n- If you play A1 \u2192 you get 3\n- If you play A2 \u2192 you delegate \u2192 now both delegate \u2192 mediator plays A0 for you \u2192 you get 2\n\nSo again, best is to play A1 \u2192 get 3.\n\nSo **in every case**, if opponent plays A2, you want to play A1.\n\nAnd if opponent plays A1, you want to play A1.\n\nIf opponent plays A0, you want to play A1.\n\nSo **A1 is always best response**.\n\nTherefore, **A2 (delegate) is never better than A1**.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s **dominated**.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause if you delegate, your action is determined by the mediator, which depends on opponent\u2019s action.\n\nBut if you play A1 directly, you **guarantee** yourself:\n\n- 3 if opponent plays A0\n- 1 if opponent plays A1\n- 3 if opponent delegates (because mediator plays A0 for them, you play A1 \u2192 3)\n\nWait \u2014 if opponent delegates, mediator plays A0 for them \u2192 you play A1 \u2192 you get 3.\n\nIf opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1.\n\nSo your payoff when you play A1 is:\n\n- 3 with prob q (opponent plays A0)\n- 1 with prob r (opponent plays A1)\n- 3 with prob s (opponent delegates \u2192 mediator plays A0)\n\nSo overall: 3*(q + s) + 1*r\n\nIf you delegate, your action is determined by mediator:\n\n- If opponent plays A0 or A1 \u2192 only you delegate \u2192 mediator plays A1 for you \u2192 you get 1 if opponent plays A1, 0 if opponent plays A0\n- If opponent delegates \u2192 both delegate \u2192 mediator plays A0 for you \u2192 you get 2 if opponent plays A0, 1 if opponent plays A1, 2 if opponent delegates\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s compute expected payoff for **you** if you choose A2 (delegate), and opponent plays mixed strategy (q0, q1, q2)\n\nThen:\n\n- With prob q0: opponent plays A0 \u2192 only you delegate \u2192 mediator plays A1 for you \u2192 you play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 3\n- With prob q1: opponent plays A1 \u2192 only you delegate \u2192 mediator plays A1 for you \u2192 you play A1, opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n- With prob q2: opponent delegates \u2192 both delegate \u2192 mediator plays A0 for you \u2192 you play A0, opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2\n\nSo your expected payoff if you delegate:\n\n= q0 * 3 + q1 * 1 + q2 * 2\n\nCompare to if you play A1 directly:\n\n= q0 * 3 + q1 * 1 + q2 * 3  \u2190 because if opponent delegates, mediator plays A0 for them, you play A1 \u2192 3\n\nSo difference:\n\nPlay A1: 3q0 + 1q1 + 3q2  \nPlay A2: 3q0 + 1q1 + 2q2\n\nSo **A1 gives you 1 extra point when opponent delegates**.\n\nTherefore:\n\n> **Playing A1 always gives at least as much as A2, and strictly more when opponent delegates.**\n\nThus, **A2 is strictly dominated by A1**.\n\nSimilarly, A0 is strictly dominated by A1 (as shown earlier).\n\nTherefore, **the only rational choice is to play A1 with probability 100%**.\n\nDelegating (A2) is never beneficial \u2014 it can only hurt you (when opponent delegates, you get 2 instead of 3).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Decision**\n\nEven with the mediator option, **A1 strictly dominates both A0 and A2**.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to play **A1 with 100% probability**.\n\nNo reason to delegate or play A0.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100, \"A2\": 0}"}]}]

The payoffs are:\n   - (A0, A0): (2,2)\n   - (A0, A1): (0,3)\n   - (A1, A0): (3,0)\n   - (A1, A1): (1,1)\n\n2. **Nash Equilibrium in Mixed Strategies (without mediator)**:\n   Let p be the probability that I choose A0, and q be the probability that the opponent chooses A0.\n   My expected payoff: \n        U = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1]\n        = p * [2q] + (1-p) * [3q + 1 - q]\n        = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n        = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n        = 2q + 1 - p   [Wait, this simplification seems wrong. Let me recalculate properly.]\n\n   Actually, let's compute correctly:\n        U = p * [2q + 0*(1-q)] + (1-p)*[3q + 1*(1-q)]\n          = p * [2q] + (1-p)*[3q + 1 - q]\n          = 2pq + (1-p)(2q + 1)\n          = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p\n          = 2q + 1 - p\n\n   But this doesn't depend on p and q in the usual way for mixed equilibrium. Alternatively, we can compute the indifference condition.\n\n   For me to be indifferent between A0 and A1, the expected payoff from A0 should equal that from A1:\n        Expected from A0: 2q + 0*(1-q) = 2q\n        Expected from A1: 3q + 1*(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\n   So for indifference: 2q = 2q + 1  => 0=1, which is impossible. This means there is no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both players use strictly mixed strategies? Actually, wait, that can't be right.\n\n   Actually, the indifference condition is for the opponent's mix that makes me indifferent. So for me to be indifferent between A0 and A1, we need:\n        2q = 2q + 1   => which has no solution. This implies that one action always dominates? But check:\n        If opponent plays q (prob A0), then:\n            My payoff for A0: 2q\n            My payoff for A1: 2q+1\n        So A1 always gives 1 more than A0. Therefore, A1 strictly dominates A0? But wait:\n            If q=1 (opponent always A0): A0 gives 2, A1 gives 3 -> A1 better.\n            If q=0 (opponent always A1): A0 gives 0, A1 gives 1 -> A1 better.\n        So indeed, A1 is strictly better regardless of what the opponent does. Therefore, the only Nash equilibrium is both playing A1 (pure strategy) with payoff (1,1).\n\n   However, this is a symmetric game and (A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium. But note that (A0,A0) is not an equilibrium because if I know opponent plays A0, I can deviate to A1 and get 3 instead of 2. Similarly, (A0,A1) and (A1,A0) are not equilibria.\n\n   So the only Nash equilibrium is (A1,A1). But this is Pareto inferior to (A0,A0) which gives (2,2). This is a classic prisoner's dilemma type? Actually, it's not exactly prisoner's dilemma because in PD, the mutual defection is worse than mutual cooperation, but here mutual defection (A1,A1) gives (1,1) which is worse than (2,2). However, there is no dominant strategy that defects? Actually, A1 is dominant: it always gives better payoff than A0.\n\n   Therefore, without the mediator, the rational choice is to always play A1.\n\n3. **Introducing the Mediator**:\n   Now we have a third action: A2 (Delegate to Mediator).\n   The mediator's behavior:\n        - If only one player delegates, it recommends A1.\n        - If both delegate, it recommends A0.\n\n   So if I delegate (A2), what happens depends on what the opponent does:\n        - If opponent does not delegate (plays A0 or A1), then only I delegate -> mediator recommends A1 for me.\n        - If opponent also delegates (A2), then both delegate -> mediator recommends A0 for me.\n\n   Therefore, the payoff for me when I choose A2 is:\n        - If opponent chooses A0: I get the payoff as if I played A1 (since only I delegate) -> which is 3 (because opponent played A0).\n        - If opponent chooses A1: I get the payoff as if I played A1 -> which is 1.\n        - If opponent chooses A2: I get the payoff as if I played A0 (since both delegate) -> which is 2 (because opponent also gets A0 from mediator).\n\n   Similarly, we can define the payoff matrix with three actions: A0, A1, A2.\n\n   Let me write the payoff matrix for me (row player) with actions A0, A1, A2 against opponent's A0, A1, A2.\n\n   For me:\n        vs opponent A0:\n            A0: 2\n            A1: 3\n            A2: (since only I delegate? Actually if I play A2 and opponent plays A0, only I delegate -> I get A1 -> payoff 3)\n        vs opponent A1:\n            A0: 0\n            A1: 1\n            A2: only I delegate -> I get A1 -> payoff 1\n        vs opponent A2:\n            A0: (opponent delegates, I don't) -> opponent gets recommendation: since only opponent delegates, mediator gives him A1. So I play A0 vs opponent A1 -> I get 0.\n            A1: I play A1 vs opponent A1 -> I get 1.\n            A2: both delegate -> mediator gives me A0 and opponent A0 -> I get 2.\n\n   So the full payoff matrix for me is:\n\n        Opponent:\n        A0   A1   A2\nMe A0:   2    0    0\nMe A1:   3    1    1\nMe A2:   3    1    2\n\n   Similarly, for the opponent (symmetric).\n\n   Now, we need to find a mixed strategy over {A0, A1, A2}.\n\n   Note: A0 is strictly dominated by A2? Compare:\n        vs A0: A0=2, A2=3 -> A2 better.\n        vs A1: A0=0, A2=1 -> A2 better.\n        vs A2: A0=0, A2=2 -> A2 better.\n   So A0 is strictly dominated by A2. Therefore, I should never play A0.\n\n   So we can eliminate A0. Now the reduced game is between A1 and A2.\n\n   Payoff for me (after eliminating A0):\n\n        Opponent:\n        A1   A2\nMe A1:   1    1\nMe A2:   1    2\n\n   Now, if opponent plays A1:\n        I get 1 from A1, 1 from A2 -> indifferent.\n   If opponent plays A2:\n        I get 1 from A1, 2 from A2 -> prefer A2.\n\n   So there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Let me find mixed.\n\n   Let q be the probability that opponent plays A1 (so 1-q for A2).\n\n   My expected payoff from A1: 1*q + 1*(1-q) = 1.\n   My expected payoff from A2: 1*q + 2*(1-q) = 2 - q.\n\n   I will prefer A2 if 2 - q > 1, i.e., q < 1.\n   I will be indifferent if q=1.\n\n   So if opponent is playing A1 with probability 1, I am indifferent. But if opponent plays A1 always, then I can play anything. However, if I play A2 with positive probability, then opponent's payoff against my mix?\n\n   Similarly, for opponent: same reasoning.\n\n   Actually, we need to find a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\n   Let me assume I play A1 with probability p, A2 with probability 1-p.\n   Opponent plays A1 with probability q, A2 with probability 1-q.\n\n   My expected payoff: p * [1] + (1-p)* [2 - q]   [since from A2: 1*q + 2*(1-q)=2-q]\n   For me to be indifferent, we need the payoff from A1 and A2 to be equal when I am mixing:\n        1 = 2 - q   => q=1.\n\n   Similarly, for opponent to be indifferent (by symmetry):\n        1 = 2 - p   => p=1.\n\n   So the only candidate is p=1, q=1. But this is pure strategy (A1,A1). However, we already saw that if both play A1, payoff is 1. But if I deviate to A2 when opponent plays A1, I get 1 (same). So it is a Nash equilibrium.\n\n   Also, if both play A2: (A2,A2) gives (2,2) which is better. But is it an equilibrium? If I know opponent plays A2, I can play A2 and get 2, or play A1 and get 1. So I prefer A2. Similarly for opponent. So (A2,A2) is also a Nash equilibrium.\n\n   So there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A1,A1) and (A2,A2). And (A2,A2) Pareto dominates (A1,A1).\n\n   Therefore, the best is to coordinate on (A2,A2). But since we choose simultaneously, we need to hope that both choose A2.\n\n   However, if I think the opponent is rational, they will also see that A2 is better. So we can both play A2.\n\n   But to be safe, we can consider that the opponent might not be rational? But in this game, we assume both are rational.\n\n   Therefore, the best response is to play A2 with probability 100.\n\n   Why not mix? Because if I mix, I might sometimes get lower payoff. For example, if I play A1 with positive probability and opponent plays A2, I get 1 instead of 2.\n\n   So strictly, A2 is better than A1 when opponent plays A2, and equally good when opponent plays A1.\n\n   Therefore, I should play A2 with probability 100.\n\n   Note: We must output probabilities for all actions, including A0. But we determined A0 is strictly dominated, so assign 0 to it.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0, \"A2\": 100}\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0, \"A2\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 2, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":0,\"A2\":100}"}]}, {"mediator": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "moves": [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Game Without Mediator**:\n   - This is a symmetric game similar to the \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game.\n   - The Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies for such a game can be found by making the opponent indifferent between their actions.\n   - Let \\( p \\) be the probability you choose A0, and \\( q \\) be the probability the opponent chooses A0.\n   - Your expected payoff if you choose A0: \\( 2q + 0(1-q) = 2q \\)\n   - Your expected payoff if you choose A1: \\( 3q + 1(1-q) = 2q + 1 \\)\n   - To make you indifferent: \\( 2q = 2q + 1 \\) which is impossible.

This indicates that there is no mixed strategy equilibrium where both players use only A0 and A1? Actually, wait, let's check the best responses.\n\n   Actually, from your perspective:\n   - If opponent uses A0: your best response is A1 (3 > 2)\n   - If opponent uses A1: your best response is A0 (0 < 1) but wait: if opponent uses A1, you get 0 for A0 and 1 for A1, so actually A1 is better.\n   So actually, A1 is always a best response? \n        If opponent A0: you prefer A1 (3>2)\n        If opponent A1: you prefer A1 (1>0)\n   So A1 strictly dominates A0? But wait: if opponent A1, you get 0 for A0 and 1 for A1, so yes A1 is always better.\n   Therefore, the only Nash equilibrium is both playing A1 (giving (1,1)), which is Pareto inferior to (2,2) but is the equilibrium.\n\n   However, this is a classic coordination game with a conflict. Actually, let's write the payoff matrix:\n\n                Opponent A0    Opponent A1\n        You A0:   (2,2)         (0,3)\n        You A1:   (3,0)         (1,1)\n\n   Indeed, A1 is a dominant strategy for you: no matter what the opponent does, you get a higher payoff with A1 (3>2 and 1>0). Similarly for the opponent.\n   So the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1).\n\n   But this is inefficient because (A0,A0) gives (2,2) which is better for both.\n\n2. **Introducing the Mediator**:\n   - Now we have a third action: A2 = \"Delegate to Mediator\".\n   - The mediator's behavior:\n        If only one player delegates (and the other does not), the mediator recommends A1 for the delegating player.\n        If both delegate, the mediator recommends A0 for both.\n\n   - So the effective payoff when including delegation:\n        We need to consider all combinations of actions including A2.\n\n   Let\u2019s define the outcomes:\n\n   Case 1: You play A2, opponent plays A2 (both delegate):\n        Mediator recommends A0 for both -> outcome is (A0,A0) -> payoff (2,2)\n\n   Case 2: You play A2, opponent plays A0 (you delegate, opponent does not):\n        Only one delegates -> mediator recommends A1 for you.\n        So you play A1, opponent plays A0 -> payoff (3,0)\n\n   Case 3: You play A2, opponent plays A1:\n        Only one delegates -> you play A1, opponent plays A1 -> payoff (1,1)\n\n   Case 4: You play A0, opponent plays A2:\n        Only one delegates -> opponent gets recommendation A1 -> opponent plays A1, you play A0 -> payoff (0,3)\n\n   Case 5: You play A1, opponent plays A2:\n        Only one delegates -> opponent gets A1 -> both play A1 -> payoff (1,1)\n\n   Case 6: You play A0, opponent plays A0: (2,2)\n   Case 7: You play A0, opponent plays A1: (0,3)\n   Case 8: You play A1, opponent plays A0: (3,0)\n   Case 9: You play A1, opponent plays A1: (1,1)\n\n   So the full payoff matrix with actions (A0, A1, A2) is:\n\n        Opponent: A0       A1       A2\n        You A0: (2,2)    (0,3)   (0,3)\n        You A1: (3,0)    (1,1)   (1,1)\n        You A2: (3,0)    (1,1)   (2,2)\n\n   Note: When you play A2 and opponent plays A0, you get (3,0) [because you end up playing A1 vs A0].\n          When you play A2 and opponent plays A1, you get (1,1) [you play A1 vs A1].\n          When you play A2 and opponent plays A2, you get (2,2) [both play A0].\n\n3. **Finding a Good Strategy**:\n   - We want to maximize our score.\n   - Notice that if both players delegate (A2), they get (2,2) which is better than the Nash equilibrium (1,1) without delegation.\n   - However, if you delegate and the opponent does not (plays A0 or A1), you get a good outcome: (3,0) if opponent A0, and (1,1) if opponent A1. Actually, if opponent plays A0, you get 3 which is great; if opponent plays A1, you get 1 which is the same as the equilibrium.\n   - But if you play A0 and opponent delegates, you get (0,3) which is bad.\n   - If you play A1 and opponent delegates, you get (1,1) which is acceptable.\n\n   Let's check for dominated strategies:\n        Comparing A0 and A1: \n            Against opponent A0: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 3 -> A1 better.\n            Against opponent A1: A0 gives 0, A1 gives 1 -> A1 better.\n            Against opponent A2: A0 gives 0, A1 gives 1 -> A1 better.\n        So A1 strictly dominates A0. Therefore, we should never play A0.\n\n        Now between A1 and A2:\n            Against opponent A0: A1 gives 3, A2 gives 3 -> same.\n            Against opponent A1: A1 gives 1, A2 gives 1 -> same.\n            Against opponent A2: A1 gives 1, A2 gives 2 -> A2 is better.\n        So A2 is at least as good as A1 in all cases, and strictly better when opponent plays A2.\n\n        Therefore, A2 (delegate) is a better action than A1, and A0 is strictly worse.\n\n   So the best strategy is to always delegate (A2) because:\n        If opponent delegates: we get 2 (which is better than 1 from A1).\n        If opponent does not delegate (plays A1 or A0): we get the same as if we had played A1.\n\n   However, note that if both players reason this way, they will both delegate and get (2,2), which is the best possible outcome for both.\n\n   Therefore, the optimal strategy is to assign probability 100% to A2.\n\n4. **Final Probability Distribution**:\n   - We should set:\n        \"A0\": 0\n        \"A1\": 0\n        \"A2\": 100\n\n   This sums to 100.\n\n   Note: The instructions say \"Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.\" So we include all three.\n\nThus, the output is:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0, \"A2\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "openai/gpt-5-nano(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\":0,\"A1\":100,\"A2\":0}"}]}]

The payoff matrix is:\n\n   - (A0, A0): (2, 2)\n   - (A0, A1): (0, 3)\n   - (A1, A0): (3, 0)\n   - (A1, A1): (1, 1)\n\n   Without delegation, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1), which is worse for both than (2,2) from (A0,A0). This creates a social dilemma.\n\n2. **Introducing Delegation (A2)**: \n   - If you delegate (choose A2), the mediator will decide for you based on how many players delegate:\n        - If only you delegate (and opponent does not): mediator recommends A1.\n        - If both delegate: mediator recommends A0.\n\n   So, effectively:\n   - If you choose A2 and opponent does not (opponent chooses A0 or A1), then you are effectively playing A1 (as per mediator rule for 1 delegation).\n   - If both choose A2, then both are recommended A0 (so both play A0).\n\n3. **Payoffs when delegation is involved**:\n   Let P be you, O be opponent.\n\n   Cases:\n   a) P chooses A2, O chooses A0:\n        Mediator recommends A1 for P (since only one delegated). So outcome is (A1, A0): payoff (3,0).\n\n   b) P chooses A2, O chooses A1:\n        Mediator recommends A1 for P. So outcome is (A1, A1): payoff (1,1).\n\n   c) P chooses A2, O chooses A2:\n        Both delegate: mediator recommends A0 for both. So outcome is (A0, A0): payoff (2,2).\n\n   d) P chooses A0 or A1, O chooses A2: symmetric to above.\n\n   So the full payoff matrix including A2 is:\n\n   | P \\ O | A0     | A1     | A2     |\n   |--------|--------|--------|--------|\n   | A0     | (2,2)  | (0,3)  | (0,3)? | Wait: if O chooses A2 and P chooses A0, then O is delegating. Since only O delegates, mediator recommends A1 for O. So outcome is (A0, A1): payoff (0,3).\n   | A1     | (3,0)  | (1,1)  | (1,1)? | Similarly: if O chooses A2 and P chooses A1, outcome is (A1, A1): (1,1).\n   | A2     | (3,0)  | (1,1)  | (2,2)  |\n\n   So corrected:\n\n   - (A0, A2): (0,3) [because O gets A1 from mediator]\n   - (A1, A2): (1,1) [both A1]\n   - (A2, A0): (3,0) [P gets A1]\n   - (A2, A1): (1,1) [both A1]\n   - (A2, A2): (2,2) [both get A0]\n\n4. **Finding a Nash Equilibrium in mixed strategies (including A2)**:\n   We need to assign probabilities to A0, A1, A2.\n\n   Let:\n      p = probability I choose A0\n      q = probability I choose A1\n      r = probability I choose A2   (with p+q+r=100)\n\n   Similarly for opponent: let them use (p_o, q_o, r_o).\n\n   Since the game is symmetric, we look for a symmetric equilibrium.\n\n   The expected payoff for each of my actions:\n\n   If I choose A0:\n        vs A0: 2\n        vs A1: 0\n        vs A2: 0   [because opponent gets A1 when they delegate]\n        So EU(A0) = 2*p_o + 0*q_o + 0*r_o = 2 p_o.\n\n   If I choose A1:\n        vs A0: 3\n        vs A1: 1\n        vs A2: 1\n        So EU(A1) = 3*p_o + 1*q_o + 1*r_o = 3p_o + q_o + r_o.\n\n   If I choose A2:\n        vs A0: 3   [I get A1]\n        vs A1: 1   [I get A1]\n        vs A2: 2   [both get A0]\n        So EU(A2) = 3*p_o + 1*q_o + 2*r_o.\n\n   In symmetric equilibrium, all actions that are played with positive probability must have the same expected payoff.\n\n   Also, we note that without delegation, (A1,A1) is the NE. But with delegation, we might get a better outcome.\n\n   Suppose we want to support (A2,A2) which gives (2,2). But is it an equilibrium?\n        If opponent plays A2 (r_o=1), then:\n            EU(A0)=0, EU(A1)=1, EU(A2)=2.\n        So I would prefer A2. So if both play A2, it is a pure strategy NE.\n\n   However, is there a mixed strategy that might be better? Actually, (A2,A2) is already a pure Nash Equilibrium: if both delegate, no one has incentive to deviate.\n\n   But we are required to output a mixed strategy? Actually, we can output a pure strategy as well (by setting one probability to 100). However, the instruction says \"choose a probability distribution\", which can be pure.\n\n   However, note: the mediator rule says \"if 2 players delegate, it recommends A0\". So (A2,A2) leads to (A0,A0) which gives (2,2). This is Pareto efficient.\n\n   Why would we not always delegate? \n        If opponent does not delegate, then:\n            If opponent plays A0: I get 3 by delegating (which is good) or by playing A1.\n            If opponent plays A1: I get 1 by delegating or by playing A1.\n        So delegating is at least as good as playing A1 when opponent does not delegate? Actually:\n            vs A0: delegating gives 3 (same as A1)\n            vs A1: delegating gives 1 (same as A1)\n            vs A2: delegating gives 2 (better than A1 which gives 1)\n        So delegating strictly dominates A1? \n\n   Compare A2 and A1:\n        EU(A2) >= EU(A1) in all cases, and strictly better when opponent delegates.\n        Also, compared to A0:\n            vs A0: A0 gives 2, A2 gives 3 -> better\n            vs A1: A0 gives 0, A2 gives 1 -> better\n            vs A2: A0 gives 0, A2 gives 2 -> better\n        So A2 strictly dominates both A0 and A1!\n\n   Therefore, it is always better to delegate. The only Nash Equilibrium is for both to delegate (A2).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The best strategy is to delegate with probability 100%. This leads to the outcome (2,2) if both delegate, which is the best possible symmetric outcome.\n\n   Therefore, we set:\n        A0: 0, A1: 0, A2: 100.\n\n   This is a pure strategy.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0, \"A2\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "C", "points": 2, "response": "Let's think through this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)\n\nWe have two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nPayoff matrix (for **you**):\n\n| You \\ Opponent | A0 | A1 |\n|----------------|----|----|\n| **A0**         | 2  | 0  |\n| **A1**         | 3  | 1  |\n\nThis is a 2-player, simultaneous-move game. We are to choose a mixed strategy (probability distribution over A0 and A1) to maximize our expected payoff, **assuming the opponent is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff**.\n\nBut now there's a twist: **we can delegate to a mediator**, which introduces a third action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the mediator mechanism\n\nThe mediator\u2019s behavior depends on **how many players delegate**:\n\n- If **1 player** delegates \u2192 mediator recommends **A1**\n- If **2 players** delegate \u2192 mediator recommends **A0**\n\nNote: There are only two players in the game (you and opponent). So possible delegation scenarios:\n\n| You delegate? | Opponent delegates? | Mediator recommendation to you | Mediator recommendation to opponent |\n|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| No            | No                  | \u2014                             | \u2014                                   |\n| Yes           | No                  | A1                            | \u2014                                   |\n| No            | Yes                 | \u2014                             | A1                                  |\n| Yes           | Yes                 | A0                            | A0                                  |\n\nImportant: The mediator **only acts if you delegate**. If you delegate, you **follow the mediator\u2019s recommendation**. So if you choose A2 (delegate), your **actual action** becomes whatever the mediator recommends, which depends on **how many total players delegated**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: **you choose your strategy simultaneously with the opponent**, and you don\u2019t know whether the opponent will delegate or not.\n\nSo your choice of A2 (delegate) affects the mediator\u2019s recommendation **to you**, but **only after both decisions are locked in**.\n\nThis creates a **meta-game** where choosing A2 changes your effective action based on the opponent\u2019s choice.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Model the full game with A2\n\nWe now have three actions: A0, A1, A2.\n\nWe must choose a probability distribution over {A0, A1, A2}, summing to 100.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Your strategy: (p, q, r) where p = P(A0), q = P(A1), r = P(A2), and p + q + r = 100.\n\nSame for opponent: (p', q', r').\n\nWe need to compute your **expected payoff** as a function of your strategy and the opponent\u2019s strategy, and then choose the best response.\n\nBut since both players are symmetric and rational, we can look for a **Nash equilibrium**.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the possible cases based on delegation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Analyze outcomes based on delegation choices\n\nWe\u2019ll compute your expected payoff for each combination of your action and opponent\u2019s action.\n\n#### Case 1: You choose A0\n\nThen your action is fixed as A0.\n\n- If opponent chooses A0 \u2192 you get 2\n- If opponent chooses A1 \u2192 you get 0\n- If opponent chooses A2 \u2192 opponent delegates \u2192 since only 1 player (opponent) delegated, mediator recommends A1 to opponent \u2192 so opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0\n\nSo if you play A0:\n\n- Payoff = 2 * P(opponent plays A0) + 0 * P(opponent plays A1) + 0 * P(opponent plays A2)\n- So: **E[A0] = 2 * p'**\n\n#### Case 2: You choose A1\n\nYour action is fixed as A1.\n\n- Opponent A0 \u2192 you get 3\n- Opponent A1 \u2192 you get 1\n- Opponent A2 \u2192 opponent delegates \u2192 only 1 delegator \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nSo:\n\n- **E[A1] = 3 * p' + 1 * q' + 1 * r' = 3p' + 1*(1 - p') = 3p' + 1 - p' = 2p' + 1**\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s be precise.\n\nActually, if opponent plays A2, then opponent\u2019s action becomes A1 (because only one delegator \u2014 them \u2014 so mediator says A1).\n\nSo:\n\n- Opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 3\n- Opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n- Opponent plays A2 \u2192 opponent\u2019s action becomes A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nSo regardless of whether opponent plays A1 or A2, you get 1.\n\nSo:\n\n**E[A1] = 3 * P(opponent plays A0) + 1 * P(opponent plays A1 or A2) = 3p' + 1*(1 - p') = 2p' + 1**\n\n#### Case 3: You choose A2 (delegate)\n\nThen your action is determined by the mediator, which depends on **how many players delegated**.\n\nThere are two possibilities:\n\n- **If opponent does NOT delegate (plays A0 or A1)** \u2192 total delegators = 1 (you) \u2192 mediator recommends **A1** to you \u2192 you play A1\n- **If opponent DOES delegate (plays A2)** \u2192 total delegators = 2 \u2192 mediator recommends **A0** to you \u2192 you play A0\n\nSo your effective action when you choose A2 is:\n\n- A1 with probability (1 - r')  [opponent doesn't delegate]\n- A0 with probability r'        [opponent delegates]\n\nTherefore, your **expected payoff** when you choose A2 is:\n\n= P(opponent doesn't delegate) * payoff(you=A1, opponent=?) + P(opponent delegates) * payoff(you=A0, opponent=?)\n\nBut we need to compute the **joint** payoff.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\nWhen you choose A2:\n\n- With probability (1 -

So (A2, A2) is **not** a Nash equilibrium!\n\nBig mistake in earlier logic.\n\nWe must be careful: when you play A2, your action is determined by the mediator **based on total delegation**.\n\nSo if opponent plays A2 (delegates), then if you also play A2, mediator gives you A0.\n\nBut if you instead play A1 (don\u2019t delegate), then only opponent delegated \u2192 mediator gives opponent A1, and you play A1 \u2192 so you play A1, opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s recast the payoff for **you** when you play A1 and opponent plays A2:\n\n- You: A1 (not delegating)\n- Opponent: A2 (delegating) \u2192 since only one delegator (opponent), mediator tells opponent to play A1 \u2192 so opponent plays A1\n- So you play A1, opponent plays A1 \u2192 payoff = 1\n\nIf you play A0 and opponent plays A2:\n\n- You: A0\n- Opponent: A2 \u2192 opponent plays A1\n- So you A0, opponent A1 \u2192 payoff = 0\n\nIf you play A2 and opponent plays A2:\n\n- Both delegate \u2192 mediator tells both to play A0 \u2192 you play A0, opponent plays A0 \u2192 payoff = 2\n\nSo let\u2019s recompute E[A2] correctly.\n\nWhen you play A2:\n\n- With probability p': opponent plays A0 \u2192 total delegators = 1 (you) \u2192 you get A1 \u2192 you play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 payoff = 3\n- With probability q': opponent plays A1 \u2192 total delegators = 1 \u2192 you get A1 \u2192 you play A1, opponent plays A1 \u2192 payoff = 1\n- With probability r': opponent plays A2 \u2192 total delegators = 2 \u2192 you get A0 \u2192 you play A0, opponent plays A0 \u2192 payoff = 2\n\nSo:\n\n**E[A2] = 3 * p' + 1 * q' + 2 * r'**\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, if both players use strategy (p, q, r), then:\n\nE[A0] = 2p  \nE[A1] = 3p + 1*(q + r) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1  \nE[A2] = 3p + 1*q + 2*r\n\nBut q = 1 - p - r, so:\n\nE[A2] = 3p + (1 - p - r) + 2r = 2p + 1 + r\n\nSo again:\n\nE[A0] = 2p  \nE[A1] = 2p + 1  \nE[A2] = 2p + 1 + r\n\nNow, suppose both players play the same mixed strategy.\n\nWe want to find p, q, r such that all actions with positive probability give equal expected payoff (Nash condition).\n\nSuppose r > 0 \u2192 then E[A2] > E[A1] (since r > 0) \u2192 so A2 is strictly better than A1 \u2192 so q should be 0.\n\nThen E[A2] = 2p + 1 + r  \nE[A1] = 2p + 1  \nE[A0] = 2p\n\nSo E[A2] > E[A1] > E[A0] \u2192 so best response is to play A2 with probability 1 \u2192 r = 1, p = q = 0\n\nBut if r = 1, then E[A2] = 2*0 + 1 + 1 = 2\n\nBut if you deviate to A1: then you play A1, opponent plays A2 \u2192 opponent\u2019s delegation \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1 < 2 \u2192 not better\n\nWait \u2014 earlier I thought if you play A1 and opponent plays A2, you get 3? That was wrong.\n\nLet me recompute **payoff when you play A1 and opponent plays A2**:\n\n- You: A1 (not delegate)\n- Opponent: A2 (delegate) \u2192 since only one delegator (opponent), mediator tells opponent to play A1\n- So actions: you = A1, opponent = A1 \u2192 payoff = 1\n\nSimilarly, if you play A0 and opponent plays A2: you = A0, opponent = A1 \u2192 payoff = 0\n\nIf you play A2 and opponent plays A2: both get A0 \u2192 payoff = 2\n\nSo if both play A2, you get 2.\n\nIf you unilaterally switch to A1: you get 1 \u2192 worse\n\nIf you switch to A0: you get 0 \u2192 worse\n\nSo **(A2:100%) is a Nash equilibrium**!\n\nBut earlier I thought if you play A1 and opponent plays A2, you get 3 \u2014 that was wrong. I confused who is doing what.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- You play A1 \u2192 your action is A1\n- Opponent plays A2 \u2192 opponent delegates \u2192 since only one delegator (opponent), mediator tells opponent to play A1 \u2192 so opponent plays A1\n- So both play A1 \u2192 payoff = 1\n\nYes.\n\nIf you play A2 and opponent plays A0:\n\n- You delegate \u2192 only you delegate \u2192 mediator tells you to play A1\n- Opponent plays A0\n- So you = A1, opponent = A0 \u2192 you get 3\n\nSo E[A2] = 3*p' + 1*q' + 2*r'\n\nWith p' = P(opponent A0), q' = P(opponent A1), r' = P(opponent A2)\n\nSo if opponent plays A2 with probability 1, then r' = 1, p' = q' = 0 \u2192 E[A2] = 2\n\nIf you play A1, you get 1\n\nSo no incentive to deviate.\n\nNow, is there a better equilibrium?\n\nSuppose both play A1 with probability 1.\n\nThen you get 1.\n\nIf you switch to A2: you delegate \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 only one delegator (you) \u2192 you play A1 \u2192 same as before \u2192 you get 1 \u2192 no gain.\n\nIf you switch to A0: you get 0 \u2192 worse.\n\nSo (A1:100%) is also a Nash equilibrium? But payoff is only 1.\n\nBut if both play A0: you get 2.\n\nIs (A0:100%) a Nash equilibrium?\n\nYou play A0, opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2.\n\nIf you switch to A1: you get 3 (since opponent plays A0) \u2192 so you get 3 > 2 \u2192 **incentive to deviate!**\n\nSo (A0, A0) is **not** Nash.\n\n(A1, A1): you get 1. If you switch to A1 \u2192 same. If you switch to A0 \u2192 get 0. If you switch to A2 \u2192 you delegate \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 you play A1 \u2192 get 1 \u2192 same. So no incentive to deviate \u2192 **Nash equilibrium with payoff 1**\n\nBut (A2, A2): you get 2. If you deviate to A0 \u2192 get 0. To A1 \u2192 get 1. So no incentive \u2192 **Nash equilibrium with payoff 2**\n\nSo (A2, A2) gives higher payoff than (A1, A1)\n\nIs there a mixed strategy equilibrium with higher than 2?\n\nSuppose we try to make E[A0] = E[A1] = E[A2]\n\nSet:\n\nE[A0] = 2p  \nE[A1] = 2p + 1  \nE[A2] = 2p + 1 + r\n\nSet E[A0] = E[A1]: 2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 0 = 1 \u2192 impossible\n\nSo E[A1] is always 1 more than E[A0]\n\nSo A0 is never a best response.\n\nSet E[A1] = E[A2]: 2p + 1 = 2p + 1 + r \u2192 r = 0\n\nSo if r = 0, then E[A1] = E[A2]\n\nThen we can have a mixed strategy between A1 and A2, with r = 0.\n\nBut if r = 0, then E[A2] = 2p + 1 = E[A1]\n\nSo if opponent plays r' = 0, then A1 and A2 give same payoff.\n\nSo you can mix between A1 and A2.\n\nBut if you mix between A1 and A2, then r > 0 \u2192 contradiction.\n\nSo only possible if r = 0 and you play only A1.\n\nBut if r = 0, then E[A2] = 2p + 1 = E[A1], so you are indifferent between A1 and A2.\n\nBut if you play A2 with any probability, then r > 0, and E[A2] > E[A1] \u2192 so you should play only A2.\n\nSo the only stable equilibria are:\n\n- Pure A2: payoff 2\n- Pure A1: payoff 1\n\nSo **A2 is strictly better**.\n\nMoreover, if you play A2, you guarantee yourself at least 1 (if opponent plays A1) or 2 (if opponent plays A2) or 3 (if opponent plays A0), but in equilibrium, opponent also plays A2 \u2192 you get 2.\n\nAnd you cannot do better than 2 in equilibrium.\n\nIs there a mixed strategy where you get more than 2?\n\nSuppose you play A2 with probability 1, opponent plays A0 with probability 1 \u2192 you get 3.\n\nBut opponent won\u2019t play A0, because if you play A2, opponent playing A0 gives them 0, while playing A2 gives them 2 \u2192 so opponent won\u2019t play A0.\n\nSo in equilibrium, both play A2 \u2192 you get 2.\n\nAnd you cannot get more than 2 in equilibrium.\n\nSo **the best Nash equilibrium is both playing A2 with probability 1**.\n\nThus, your optimal strategy is to **delegate to the mediator with probability 100%**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0, \"A2\": 100}"}]}, {"mediator": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "moves": [{"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Game**: This is a symmetric game similar to the \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" but with slightly different payoffs. The payoff matrix is:\n   - (A0, A0): (2, 2)\n   - (A0, A1): (0, 3)\n   - (A1, A0): (3, 0)\n   - (A1, A1): (1, 1)\n\n   Without delegation, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1) since each player has an incentive to choose A1 regardless of the other's choice (because: if opponent chooses A0, you get 3 with A1 vs 2 with A0; if opponent chooses A1, you get 1 with A1 vs 0 with A0). So both choose A1 and get (1,1).\n\n2. **Introducing Delegation (A2)**: \n   - If you delegate (A2) and the opponent does not delegate, then only you delegate. The mediator recommends A1 for you (since 1 player delegated). So:\n        - You play A1 (via mediator), opponent plays independently (say action X).\n        - Outcomes: \n            If opponent plays A0: you get 3, opponent gets 0.\n            If opponent plays A1: you get 1, opponent gets 1.\n   - If both delegate, the mediator recommends A0 for both (since 2 players delegated). So both play A0 and get (2,2).\n\n3. **Payoff when delegating**:\n   - If you delegate (A2) and opponent does not (plays independently with some mix), your expected payoff depends on opponent's strategy.\n   - Similarly, if opponent delegates and you don't.\n   - If both delegate, you both get 2.\n\n4. **Goal**: Maximize your score. Since the game is symmetric, we look for a symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium over {A0, A1, A2}.\n\n5. **Let\u2019s denote**:\n   - Let p = probability of A0\n   - q = probability of A1\n   - r = probability of A2 (delegate)\n   with p+q+r=100.\n\n   We need to find p,q,r such that all actions chosen with positive probability give the same expected payoff (if they are all used in equilibrium).\n\n6. **Expected payoffs for each action** (assuming symmetric strategy (p,q,r) for both):\n   - If you play A0:\n        Opponent plays A0 with prob p: you get 2\n        Opponent plays A1 with prob q: you get 0\n        Opponent delegates (A2) with prob r: then if opponent delegates, mediator makes them play A0 (since 2 delegates? Wait no: when you play A0 and opponent delegates, only opponent delegates so mediator recommends A1 for them. So opponent plays A1.\n        So when opponent delegates, you get 0 (because you play A0, opponent plays A1).\n        So expected payoff for A0 = 2p + 0*q + 0*r = 2p.\n\n   - If you play A1:\n        Opponent A0: you get 3\n        Opponent A1: you get 1\n        Opponent delegates: mediator recommends A1 for them (since only one delegate), so opponent plays A1 -> you get 1.\n        So expected payoff for A1 = 3p + 1*q + 1*r = 3p + q + r.\n\n   - If you delegate (A2):\n        Then mediator will recommend:\n            If opponent does not delegate (prob 1-r): mediator recommends A1 for you -> you play A1.\n                Then if opponent plays A0: you get 3\n                Opponent plays A1: you get 1\n                Opponent delegates: but if both delegate, mediator recommends A0 for both? Wait: when you delegate and opponent does not, only you delegate -> mediator recommends A1 for you.\n            So expected payoff when you delegate and opponent does not (prob 1-r): same as playing A1 against opponent's independent move: 3p + 1*q + 1*r? But wait: when opponent delegates (r), actually both delegate? No: if you delegate and opponent delegates, then both delegate -> mediator recommends A0 for both -> you get 2.\n        So we need to break it:\n            Case 1: opponent does not delegate (prob 1-r): you play A1 (mediator recommendation for single delegate). Then:\n                Opponent plays A0 (p): you get 3\n                Opponent plays A1 (q): you get 1\n            So expected: [3p + 1*q] / (1-r)  [conditional on opponent not delegating]\n            But overall: (1-r)*(3p + q)/(1-r) = 3p+q.\n            However, note: when opponent does not delegate, the probability that opponent plays A0 is p/(p+q) and A1 is q/(p+q). But since we are multiplying by (1-r), it simplifies.\n\n            Case 2: opponent delegates (prob r): both delegate -> mediator recommends A0 for both -> you get 2.\n        So total expected payoff for delegating: (1-r)*(3p + q) + r*2.\n\n        But wait: actually (1-r) is the probability opponent does not delegate, and in that case your payoff is 3p + q (because you play A1 against opponent's mix of A0 and A1). And when opponent delegates (r), you get 2.\n        So: E(A2) = (1-r)*(3p + q) + 2r.\n\n7. **In symmetric equilibrium**, all actions should have same expected payoff if used with positive probability.\n\n   So set E(A0) = E(A1) = E(A2).\n\n   E(A0) = 2p\n   E(A1) = 3p + q + r\n   E(A2) = (1-r)*(3p+q) + 2r\n\n   Also p+q+r=100.\n\n   Since we are looking for a mixed strategy that uses all actions, assume p,q,r>0.\n\n   Set E(A0)=E(A1):\n        2p = 3p + q + r\n        => 0 = p + q + r = 100?  This implies 0=100, contradiction.\n\n   So it is not possible to have all three actions with positive probability in equilibrium.\n\n8. **Try without delegation (r=0)**:\n   Then we have the original game, and the equilibrium is to play A1 with probability 100 (since it is dominant). So (p=0,q=100,r=0) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\n   But with delegation available, we might do better.\n\n9. **Consider using delegation only (r=100)**:\n   If both delegate, both get 2. This is better than (1,1) from the Nash without delegation.\n\n   So if both choose to delegate, they get (2,2). This is a Pareto improvement.\n\n   So (r=100) is a Nash equilibrium: if you know opponent delegates, your best response is to delegate (get 2) rather than play independently (if you play independently, say A0: you get 0 because opponent delegates and plays A1; if you play A1: you get 1 because opponent plays A1). So delegating gives 2 which is better.\n\n   Similarly, if opponent delegates, you should delegate.\n\n10. **Is there a mixed strategy with only A0 and A2? Or A1 and A2?**\n    Since E(A0) and E(A1) cannot both be equal to E(A2) with positive p and q, we should consider pure strategies: either delegate always (r=100) or not.\n\n    The delegation equilibrium (r=100) gives payoff 2, which is higher than the non-delegation equilibrium (1).\n\n11. **Therefore**, the best strategy is to always delegate.\n\n    So we set:\n        p = 0 (A0)\n        q = 0 (A1)\n        r = 100 (Delegate)\n\n12. **Final Answer**:\n    We output probabilities for A0, A1, and A2 (delegate).\n\n    Note: The problem says \"Consider A2 as an additional action 'Delegate to Mediator'\".\n\n    So the JSON should have keys \"A0\", \"A1\", \"A2\".\n\n    We set:\n        \"A0\": 0\n        \"A1\": 0\n        \"A2\": 100\n\n    This sums to 100.\n\nReasoning: By always delegating, we achieve the outcome (2,2) if both do it, which is better than the non-cooperative Nash (1,1). And it is an equilibrium since no one has incentive to deviate.\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0, \"A2\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's think through this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)\n\nWe have two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nPayoff matrix (for **you**):\n\n| You \\ Opponent | A0 | A1 |\n|----------------|----|----|\n| **A0**         | 2  | 0  |\n| **A1**         | 3  | 1  |\n\nThis is a 2-player, simultaneous-move game.

So if you choose A2 (delegate), your **actual action** becomes whatever the mediator recommends, which depends on **how many total players delegated**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: **you choose your strategy simultaneously with the opponent**, and you don\u2019t know whether the opponent will delegate or not.\n\nSo your choice of A2 (delegate) affects the mediator\u2019s recommendation **to you**, but **only after both decisions are locked in**.\n\nThis creates a **meta-game** where choosing A2 changes your effective action based on the opponent\u2019s choice.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Model the full game with A2\n\nWe now have three actions: A0, A1, A2.\n\nWe must choose a probability distribution over {A0, A1, A2}, summing to 100.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Your strategy: (p, q, r) where p = P(A0), q = P(A1), r = P(A2), and p + q + r = 100.\n\nSame for opponent: (p', q', r').\n\nWe need to compute your **expected payoff** as a function of your strategy and the opponent\u2019s strategy, and then choose the best response.\n\nBut since both players are symmetric and rational, we can look for a **Nash equilibrium**.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the possible cases based on delegation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Analyze outcomes based on delegation choices\n\nWe\u2019ll compute your expected payoff for each combination of your action and opponent\u2019s action.\n\n#### Case 1: You choose A0\n\nThen your action is fixed as A0.\n\n- If opponent chooses A0 \u2192 you get 2\n- If opponent chooses A1 \u2192 you get 0\n- If opponent chooses A2 \u2192 opponent delegates \u2192 since only 1 player (opponent) delegated, mediator recommends A1 to opponent \u2192 so opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0\n\nSo if you play A0:\n\n- Payoff = 2 * P(opponent plays A0) + 0 * P(opponent plays A1) + 0 * P(opponent plays A2)\n- So: **E[A0] = 2 * p'**\n\n#### Case 2: You choose A1\n\nYour action is fixed as A1.\n\n- Opponent A0 \u2192 you get 3\n- Opponent A1 \u2192 you get 1\n- Opponent A2 \u2192 opponent delegates \u2192 only 1 delegator \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nSo:\n\n- **E[A1] = 3 * p' + 1 * q' + 1 * r' = 3p' + 1*(1 - p') = 3p' + 1 - p' = 2p' + 1**\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s be precise.\n\nActually, if opponent plays A2, then opponent\u2019s action becomes A1 (because only one delegator \u2014 them \u2014 so mediator says A1).\n\nSo:\n\n- Opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 3\n- Opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1\n- Opponent plays A2 \u2192 opponent\u2019s action becomes A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nSo regardless of whether opponent plays A1 or A2, you get 1.\n\nSo:\n\n**E[A1] = 3 * P(opponent plays A0) + 1 * P(opponent plays A1 or A2) = 3p' + 1*(1 - p') = 2p' + 1**\n\n#### Case 3: You choose A2 (delegate)\n\nThen your action is determined by the mediator, which depends on **how many players delegated**.\n\nThere are two possibilities:\n\n- **If opponent does NOT delegate (plays A0 or A1)** \u2192 total delegators = 1 (you) \u2192 mediator recommends **A1** to you \u2192 you play A1\n- **If opponent DOES delegate (plays A2)** \u2192 total delegators = 2 \u2192 mediator recommends **A0** to you \u2192 you play A0\n\nSo your effective action when you choose A2 is:\n\n- A1 with probability (1 - r')  [opponent doesn't delegate]\n- A0 with probability r'        [opponent delegates]\n\nTherefore, your **expected payoff** when you choose A2 is:\n\n= P(opponent doesn't delegate) * payoff(you=A1, opponent=?) + P(opponent delegates) * payoff(you=A0, opponent=?)\n\nBut we need to compute the **joint** payoff.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\nWhen you choose A2:\n\n- With probability (1 - r'): you play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 payoff = 3\n- With probability (1 - r'): you play A1, opponent plays A1 \u2192 payoff = 1\n- With probability (1 - r'): you play A1, opponent plays A2 \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 payoff = 1\n\nWait \u2014 opponent\u2019s action is independent of your delegation.\n\nActually, when you delegate (A2), your action becomes A1 if opponent does **not** delegate, and A0 if opponent **does** delegate.\n\nSo:\n\n- If opponent plays A0 (prob p'): then you play A1 \u2192 payoff = 3\n- If opponent plays A1 (prob q'): then you play A1 \u2192 payoff = 1\n- If opponent plays A2 (prob r'): then you play A0 \u2192 payoff = 2\n\nSo:\n\n**E[A2] = 3 * p' + 1 * q' + 2 * r'**\n\nThat\u2019s the key!\n\nSo to summarize your expected payoffs:\n\n| Your Action | Expected Payoff (as function of opponent\u2019s p', q', r') |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| A0          | 2 * p'                                                 |\n| A1          | 3 * p' + 1 * (q' + r') = 3p' + 1*(1 - p') = 2p' + 1    |\n| A2          | 3 * p' + 1 * q' + 2 * r'                               |\n\nNote: q' = 1 - p' - r'\n\nSo substitute:\n\nE[A2] = 3p' + 1*(1 - p' - r') + 2r'  \n= 3p' + 1 - p' - r' + 2r'  \n= 2p' + 1 + r'\n\nSo:\n\n- E[A0] = 2p'\n- E[A1] = 2p' + 1\n- E[A2] = 2p' + 1 + r'\n\nInteresting!\n\nSo E[A1] = 2p' + 1  \nE[A2] = 2p' + 1 + r'\n\nSince r' \u2265 0, then **E[A2] \u2265 E[A1]**, and **E[A2] > E[A1]** if r' > 0.\n\nAlso, E[A1] = 2p' + 1 > 2p' = E[A0] always.\n\nSo **E[A2] \u2265 E[A1] > E[A0]**, with strict inequality if r' > 0.\n\nBut r' is the opponent\u2019s probability of delegating \u2014 which we don\u2019t control.\n\nWe are trying to choose our own strategy (p, q, r) to maximize our payoff, assuming opponent is also rational.\n\nWe need to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium.\n\nAssume both players use the same strategy: (p, q, r)\n\nThen for each player, opponent\u2019s p' = p, q' = q, r' = r\n\nSo:\n\n- E[A0] = 2p\n- E[A1] = 2p + 1\n- E[A2] = 2p + 1 + r\n\nWe want to find (p, q, r) such that no player wants to deviate.\n\nNote: E[A2] = 2p + 1 + r  \nE[A1] = 2p + 1\n\nSo E[A2] = E[A1] + r\n\nSince r \u2265 0, E[A2] \u2265 E[A1], and strictly greater if r > 0.\n\nSo if r > 0, then A2 gives strictly higher payoff than A1.\n\nBut if r > 0, then E[A2] > E[A1] > E[A0], so best response is to play A2 with probability 1.\n\nBut if both play A2 with probability 1, then r = 1, r' = 1.\n\nThen E[A2] = 2p + 1 + r = 2*0 + 1 + 1 = 2\n\nBut if you deviate to A0: E[A0] = 2p = 0 \u2192 worse  \nIf you deviate to A1: E[A1] = 2p + 1 = 1 \u2192 worse\n\nSo (A2:100%) is a **Nash equilibrium**?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s check the payoff when both play A2.\n\nIf both delegate \u2192 mediator recommends A0 to both \u2192 so both play A0 \u2192 payoff = 2 each.\n\nSo actual outcome: both get 2.\n\nNow, suppose you deviate to A1 while opponent plays A2.\n\nThen: opponent delegates \u2192 so opponent plays A0 (because 2 delegators \u2192 mediator says A0)\n\nYou play A1 \u2192 so you get 3 (since you A1, opponent A0)\n\nSo your payoff = 3 > 2 \u2192 **you have incentive to deviate!**\n\nOh! So (A2, A2) is **not** a Nash equilibrium!\n\nBig mistake above.\n\nLet\u2019s recompute carefully.\n\nWhen you play A2 and opponent plays A2 \u2192 mediator says A0 to both \u2192 you play A0, opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2.\n\nBut if you unilaterally switch to A1, while opponent still plays A2:\n\n- Opponent delegates \u2192 so opponent\u2019s action = A0 (because 2 delegators \u2192 A0)\n- You play A1 \u2192 so you get 3\n\nSo payoff jumps from 2 to 3 \u2192 **you benefit from deviating**.\n\nSo playing A2 is **not** a best response if opponent plays A2.\n\nSimilarly, if opponent plays A2, what is your best response?\n\nOpponent plays A2 \u2192 so opponent\u2019s action = A0 (because 2 delegators \u2192 A0)\n\nSo opponent is effectively playing A0.\n\nThen your best response to A0 is A1 \u2192 payoff 3.\n\nSo if opponent plays A2, you should play A1.\n\nSimilarly, if opponent plays A1, your best response is A1 (payoff 1) or A0 (payoff 0) \u2192 so A1.\n\nWait, if opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 1 if you play A1, 0 if you play A0 \u2192 so A1 is better.\n\nIf opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2 if A0, 3 if A1 \u2192 so A1 is better.\n\nSo in all cases, **A1 is better than A0**.\n\nNow, what if opponent plays A2?\n\nAs above \u2192 opponent\u2019s action becomes A0 \u2192 so you should play A1 \u2192 get 3.\n\nSo **no matter what opponent does, your best response is A1**?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s check:\n\n- Opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get 2 (A0) or 3 (A1) \u2192 A1 better\n- Opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get 0 (A0) or 1 (A1) \u2192 A1 better\n- Opponent plays A2 \u2192 opponent\u2019s action becomes A1 (if only opponent delegates) or A0 (if both delegate)\n\nWait \u2014 we need to be careful.\n\nActually, when you choose your action, you don\u2019t know what opponent will do.\n\nBut for best response, we assume opponent\u2019s strategy is fixed.\n\nSo suppose opponent plays a mixed strategy (p', q', r').\n\nThen your expected payoffs:\n\nAs before:\n\n- E[A0] = 2p'\n- E[A1] = 3p' + 1*(q' + r') = 3p' + 1 - p' = 2p' + 1\n- E[A2] = 3p' + 1*q' + 2*r' = 3p' + q' + 2r'\n\nBut q' = 1 - p' - r'\n\nSo E[A2] = 3p' + (1 - p' - r') + 2r' = 2p' + 1 + r'\n\nSo:\n\nE[A0] = 2p'  \nE[A1] = 2p' + 1  \nE[A2] = 2p' + 1 + r'\n\nNow, since r' \u2265 0, E[A2] \u2265 E[A1], and E[A1] > E[A0]\n\nSo if r' > 0, then E[A2] > E[A1] \u2192 so A2 is best\n\nBut if r' = 0, then E[A2] = E[A1] = 2p' + 1\n\nSo if opponent does **not** delegate (r' = 0), then A1 and A2 are equally good.\n\nBut if opponent **does** delegate (r' > 0), then A2 is strictly better than A1.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: if you play A2, then r > 0, which affects the mediator\u2019s recommendation.\n\nBut in best response, we assume opponent\u2019s strategy is fixed.\n\nSo suppose opponent plays r' > 0 \u2192 then E[A2] > E[A1] \u2192 you should play A2.\n\nBut if you play A2, then your own r > 0, which might make opponent want to play A1 instead.\n\nThis is getting complex.\n\nLet\u2019s look for a symmetric equilibrium where both players use the same strategy (p, q, r)\n\nAssume p + q + r = 1\n\nWe want that each action in the support gives equal expected payoff (for mixed strategy equilibrium)\n\nSuppose both play A1 with probability 1: (p=0, q=1, r=0)\n\nThen:\n\nE[A0] = 2*0 = 0  \nE[A1] = 2*0 + 1 = 1  \nE[A2] = 2*0 + 1 + 0 = 1\n\nSo E[A1] = E[A2] = 1 > E[A0] = 0\n\nSo you are indifferent between A1 and A2.\n\nSo you could deviate to A2.\n\nIf you deviate to A2, then your r becomes 1, opponent still plays r'=0 \u2192 so your E[A2] = 2*0 + 1 + 0 = 1 \u2192 same as before.\n\nBut now, if you play A2 and opponent plays A1, what happens?\n\nYou delegate \u2192 since only you delegate \u2192 mediator recommends A1 to you \u2192 you play A1\n\nOpponent plays A1 \u2192 so both play A1 \u2192 payoff = 1\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nBut what if both play A2 with probability r?\n\nSuppose both play r = 1 \u2192 both delegate \u2192 both play A0 \u2192 payoff = 2\n\nBut if you deviate to A1 \u2192 opponent still delegates \u2192 opponent plays A0 \u2192 you play A1 \u2192 you get 3 > 2 \u2192 so not equilibrium.\n\nSuppose both play r = 0 \u2192 both play A1 \u2192 payoff = 1\n\nBut if you deviate to A2 \u2192 you delegate \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 so only you delegate \u2192 mediator recommends A1 to you \u2192 you play A1 \u2192 same as before \u2192 payoff = 1\n\nSo no gain.\n\nBut what if you play A0? Then you get 0 \u2192 worse.\n\nSo (A1:100%) is a Nash equilibrium? Let\u2019s check.\n\nIf opponent plays A1 (q'=1, p'=0, r'=0)\n\nThen:\n\nE[A0] = 2*0 = 0  \nE[A1] = 2*0 + 1 = 1  \nE[A2] = 2*0 + 1 + 0 = 1\n\nSo you are indifferent between A1 and A2.\n\nSo you could play A2, but it doesn\u2019t improve payoff.\n\nSo (A1:100%) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut is there a better one?\n\nSuppose both play A2 with probability r, and A1 with probability 1-r.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find a mixed strategy where E[A1] = E[A2]\n\nSet E[A1] = E[A2]\n\n2p' + 1 = 2p' + 1 + r' \u2192 implies r' = 0\n\nSo only when r' = 0 are they equal.\n\nSo if opponent plays r' = 0, then A1 and A2 are equally good.\n\nBut if opponent plays r' > 0, then A2 is better.\n\nBut if you play A2, you increase r, which might make opponent want to play A1.\n\nLet\u2019s try a symmetric equilibrium where both play A1 with probability 1 - r, and A2 with probability r.\n\nThen opponent\u2019s p' = 0, q' = 1 - r, r' = r\n\nThen your expected payoffs:\n\nE[A0] = 2*0 = 0  \nE[A1] = 2*0 + 1 = 1  \nE[A2] = 2*0 + 1 + r = 1 + r\n\nSo E[A2] = 1 + r > 1 = E[A1] \u2192 so you want to play A2 with higher probability.\n\nSo if you increase r, E[A2] increases \u2192 so best response is to increase r.\n\nBut if r increases, then E[A2] increases further \u2192 so you want r=1.\n\nBut if r=1, then as before, E[A2] = 1 + 1 = 2, but when you play A2 and opponent plays A2, you actually get 2 (because both play A0), but if you deviate to A1, you get 3.\n\nSo contradiction.\n\nSo the only stable equilibrium is when r=0 and both play A1.\n\nBecause:\n\n- If opponent plays A1, your best response is A1 or A2, both give 1.\n- If you play A2, you still get 1 (because opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get A1 from mediator \u2192 payoff 1)\n- So no incentive to change.\n\nAnd if you try to play A2, you don\u2019t get higher payoff.\n\nSo (A1:100%) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nIs there another?\n\nWhat if both play A0? Then payoff = 2.\n\nBut if you deviate to A1, you get 3 > 2 \u2192 not equilibrium.\n\nWhat if both play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1-p.\n\nThen E[A0] = 2p  \nE[A1] = 3p + 1*(1-p) = 2p + 1\n\nSo E[A1] > E[A0] always \u2192 so best to play A1.\n\nSo pure A1 is the only pure Nash equilibrium.\n\nNow, what about mixed with A2?\n\nSuppose you play A1 with prob 1 - r, A2 with r.\n\nOpponent does same.\n\nThen your expected payoff when you play A1: 1 (as before)\n\nWhen you play A2: 1 + r (as above)\n\nSo to make you indifferent, need 1 = 1 + r \u2192 r=0\n\nSo only equilibrium is r=0, play A1.\n\nThus, **the unique Nash equilibrium is both players play A1 with probability 1**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if we consider that when you play A2, and opponent plays A1, you get A1 from mediator, so same as playing A1.\n\nSo playing A2 is **dominated** by A1? Not exactly \u2014 it\u2019s equivalent in payoff when opponent doesn\u2019t delegate, and worse when opponent delegates? No.\n\nWait \u2014 when opponent delegates (r' > 0), then E[A2] > E[A1]\n\nBut if opponent delegates, then opponent is playing A2, which means opponent is not playing A1.\n\nSo if opponent plays A2, then opponent\u2019s action is A0 or A1 depending on how many delegate.\n\nBut in symmetric equilibrium, if both play A2, it\u2019s unstable.\n\nSo the only stable point is when no one delegates, and both play A1.\n\nMoreover, playing A2 gives no advantage over A1 unless opponent also delegates \u2014 but if opponent delegates, then you get A0, which is worse than A1 if opponent plays A1.\n\nActually, let\u2019s compute the **expected payoff** of playing A1 vs A2 when opponent plays A1 with probability 1.\n\nThen:\n\n- Play A1: you get 1\n- Play A2: you delegate \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 only you delegate \u2192 mediator says A1 \u2192 you play A1 \u2192 you get 1\n\nSame.\n\nIf opponent plays A0 with probability 1:\n\n- A1: you get 3\n- A2: you delegate \u2192 only you \u2192 mediator says A1 \u2192 you play A1 \u2192 get 3\n\nSame.\n\nIf opponent plays A2 with probability 1:\n\n- A1: you get 3 (because opponent plays A0)\n- A2: you delegate \u2192 both delegate \u2192 mediator says A0 \u2192 you play A0 \u2192 get 2\n\nSo here, A1 gives 3, A2 gives 2 \u2192 so A1 is better.\n\nSo in **all cases**, playing A1 gives **at least as high** payoff as A2, and sometimes higher.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If opponent plays A0 \u2192 A1:3, A2:3 \u2192 same\n- If opponent plays A1 \u2192 A1:1, A2:1 \u2192 same\n- If opponent plays A2 \u2192 A1:3, A2:2 \u2192 A1 better\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A2**.\n\nBecause in one case (opponent plays A2), A1 gives higher payoff, and in others equal.\n\nTherefore, **A2 is strictly dominated by A1**.\n\nSo rational players will never play A2.\n\nTherefore, the game reduces to the original 2-action game.\n\nIn the original game, the unique Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies?\n\nLet\u2019s find it.\n\nYou play A0 with prob p, A1 with 1-p\n\nOpponent plays A0 with prob p', A1 with 1-p'\n\nYour expected payoff:\n\nE = p * [2p' + 0*(1-p')] + (1-p) * [3p' + 1*(1-p')]  \n= p*2p' + (1-p)(3p' + 1 - p')  \n= 2p p' + (1-p)(2p' + 1)\n\n= 2p p' + 2p' + 1 - 2p p' - p  \n= 2p' + 1 - p\n\nTo find Nash equilibrium, set your p to make opponent indifferent.\n\nOpponent\u2019s payoff (symmetric):\n\nE_opponent = 2p + 1 - p'  (by symmetry)\n\nSet opponent indifferent between A0 and A1:\n\nE[A0] = 2p  \nE[A1] = 3p + 1*(1-p) = 2p + 1\n\nSet equal: 2p = 2p + 1 \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo no mixed strategy equilibrium in the original game? But we know pure strategy equilibria.\n\nActually, in the original 2x2 game:\n\nPayoffs:\n\nYou \\ Opp | A0 | A1  \nA0       | 2,2| 0,3  \nA1       | 3,0| 1,1\n\nThis is similar to Battle of the Sexes or Chicken.\n\nPure Nash equilibria:\n\n- (A0, A0): both get 2. If you deviate to A1, you get 3 > 2 \u2192 not equilibrium.\n- (A1, A1): both get 1. If you deviate to A0, you get 0 < 1 \u2192 so no incentive to deviate? Wait: if opponent plays A1, you get 1 if you play A1, 0 if you play A0 \u2192 so A1 is best. So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\n- (A0, A1): you get 0, opponent gets 3. You want to switch to A1 to get 1 > 0 \u2192 not equilibrium.\n- (A1, A0): you get 3, opponent gets 0. Opponent wants to switch to A1 to get 1 > 0 \u2192 not equilibrium.\n\nSo only pure Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)\n\nAnd since A2 is strictly dominated by A1, we ignore it.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100%.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100, \"A2\": 0}"}]}]

Let p be the probability that you choose A0, and q be the probability that the opponent chooses A0.\n\n   Your expected payoff: \n      U_you = p * [q*2 + (1-q)*0] + (1-p) * [q*3 + (1-q)*1] = 2pq + 3(1-p)q + (1-p)(1-q) = 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq = (2pq - 3pq + pq) + (3q - q) + 1 - p = 0pq + 2q + 1 - p.\n\n   Actually, let's simplify properly:\n      U_you = p*(2q + 0*(1-q)) + (1-p)*(3q + 1*(1-q)) = p*2q + (1-p)*(3q + 1 - q) = 2pq + (1-p)*(2q+1) = 2pq + 2q + 1 - 2pq - p = 2q + 1 - p.\n\n   Similarly, the opponent's expected payoff is symmetric: U_opp = 2p + 1 - q.\n\n   To make the opponent indifferent between A0 and A1, we set:\n        Payoff for opponent playing A0: 2p + 0*(1-p) = 2p.\n        Payoff for opponent playing A1: 0*p + 1*(1-p) = 1-p.\n        So, 2p = 1-p  => 3p=1 => p=1/3.\n\n   Similarly, to make you indifferent, q=1/3.\n\n   So the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (p=1/3, q=1/3), meaning each player chooses A0 with probability 1/3 and A1 with probability 2/3.\n\n   At this equilibrium, the expected payoff for each is: U_you = 2*(1/3) + 1 - (1/3) = 2/3 + 2/3 = 4/3 \u2248 1.333.\n\n3. **Introducing the Mediator**:\n   Now we have an additional action: A2 = \"Delegate to Mediator\".\n\n   The mediator's behavior:\n      - If 1 player delegates (and the other does not), the mediator recommends A1 for the delegating player.\n      - If both delegate, the mediator recommends A0 for both.\n\n   So, if you delegate (A2) and the opponent does not (plays A0 or A1), you effectively play A1.\n   If both delegate, both play A0.\n\n   Therefore, we can translate the outcomes with delegation:\n\n   - (A2, A0): same as (A1, A0) because you delegate -> A1, opponent A0 -> (3,0)\n   - (A2, A1): same as (A1, A1) -> (1,1)\n   - (A0, A2): same as (A0, A1) -> (0,3)\n   - (A1, A2): same as (A1, A1) -> (1,1)\n   - (A2, A2): both delegate -> both play A0 -> (2,2)\n\n   So the full payoff matrix including A2 is:\n\n        Opponent\n        A0    A1    A2\nYou A0  (2,2) (0,3) (0,3)\n    A1  (3,0) (1,1) (1,1)\n    A2  (3,0) (1,1) (2,2)\n\n4. **Finding the Best Response**:\n   We need to choose probabilities for A0, A1, A2 that sum to 100.\n\n   Let:\n        p0 = prob you choose A0\n        p1 = prob you choose A1\n        p2 = prob you choose A2\n\n   Similarly for opponent: q0, q1, q2.\n\n   Your expected payoff:\n        U = p0 * [2*q0 + 0*q1 + 0*q2] \n           + p1 * [3*q0 + 1*q1 + 1*q2]\n           + p2 * [3*q0 + 1*q1 + 2*q2]\n\n        = p0*(2q0) + p1*(3q0 + q1 + q2) + p2*(3q0 + q1 + 2q2)\n\n   Since the game is symmetric, we can look for a symmetric equilibrium where you and the opponent use the same strategy.\n\n   Assume the opponent uses (q0, q1, q2). Then we choose (p0,p1,p2) to maximize U.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the payoffs for each of your actions against the opponent's mixed strategy:\n\n        If you play A0: payoff = 2q0\n        If you play A1: payoff = 3q0 + q1 + q2\n        If you play A2: payoff = 3q0 + q1 + 2q2\n\n   Note that A2 is always at least as good as A1: because the only difference is when both delegate (q2>0), which gives 2 instead of 1. So A2 dominates A1. Therefore, we should never choose A1; we should always prefer A2 over A1.\n\n   So we can set p1=0.\n\n   Then we only need to choose between A0 and A2.\n\n   Now, compare A0 and A2:\n        A0: 2q0\n        A2: 3q0 + q1 + 2q2\n\n   But since we set p1=0, and similarly the opponent should set q1=0 (by symmetry), we can assume q1=0.\n\n   Then:\n        A0: 2q0\n        A2: 3q0 + 2q2\n\n   And since q0 + q2 = 1 (because q1=0), we have:\n        A0: 2q0\n        A2: 3q0 + 2(1-q0) = 3q0 + 2 - 2q0 = 2 + q0\n\n   So A2 always gives 2 + q0, which is always greater than A0's 2q0 (since q0<=1, 2+q0 >= 2q0). In fact, for q0 in [0,1]:\n        2 + q0 >= 2q0   => 2 >= q0, which is always true.\n\n   Therefore, A2 strictly dominates A0 as well? Let's check:\n        If q0=0: A0=0, A2=2.\n        If q0=1: A0=2, A2=3.\n\n   So indeed, A2 always gives a higher payoff than A0. Therefore, the best response is to always play A2 (delegate).\n\n   But if both always delegate (p2=1, q2=1), then the outcome is (2,2), which is good.\n\n   However, if the opponent always delegates, then your payoff from A2 is 2 (from (A2,A2)), and from A0 it would be 0 (if you play A0 and opponent delegates, which is like A1 for opponent -> (0,3)), and from A1 it would be 1 (like (A1,A1)).\n\n   So indeed, A2 is the best.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Since A2 (delegate) strictly dominates both A0 and A1, the optimal strategy is to delegate with probability 100.\n\n   Therefore, we set:\n        A0: 0, A1: 0, A2: 100.\n\n   This is a Nash equilibrium: if both always delegate, both get 2, which is better than the mixed Nash without mediator (which gave 1.333). Also, no one has an incentive to deviate: if you deviate to A0, you get 0; to A1, you get 1; both worse than 2.\n\n   So the symmetric equilibrium is to always delegate.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0, \"A2\": 100}\n```"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - (A0, A0): (2, 2)\n   - (A0, A1): (0, 3)\n   - (A1, A0): (3, 0)\n   - (A1, A1): (1, 1)\n\n   This is similar to a \"Chicken\" or \"Hawk-Dove\" game.

Also, E(A2) - E(A0) = (3p' + q' + 2r') - 2p' = p' + q' + 2r' = (1 - r') + 2r' = 1 + r' > 0, so E(A2) > E(A0).\n\n   Therefore, if the opponent uses any positive r' (delegation), then A2 is strictly better than both A0 and A1.

So we should always choose A2 if the opponent delegates with positive probability.\n\n   But if the opponent never delegates (r'=0), then:\n      E(A0)=2p', E(A1)=3p' + q' = 3p' + (1-p') = 1+2p', E(A2)=3p' + q' = 1+2p' (same as A1).\n   Also, E(A1) - E(A0) = (1+2p') - 2p' = 1 > 0, so A1 and A2 are better than A0.\n\n   So if opponent doesn't delegate, we should play A1 or A2 (which are equivalent in payoff when r'=0).\n\n   However, if we both always delegate (r=1), then we get (2,2) which is better than the Nash without delegation (1,1). So there is an incentive to both delegate.\n\n   Therefore, the symmetric Nash Equilibrium should be both players delegating with probability 1. Why?\n      If both delegate (r=1), then:\n         E(A2) = 3*0 + 1*0 + 2*1 = 2.\n         If we deviate to A0: E(A0)=2*0 + 0*0 + 0*1=0 <2.\n         If we deviate to A1: E(A1)=3*0 +1*0 +1*1=1 <2.\n      So no incentive to deviate.\n\n   So the equilibrium is to always delegate.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The best strategy is to choose A2 (delegate) with probability 100. This gives a payoff of 2 if the opponent also delegates (which they should in equilibrium), and if they don't, we still get at least 1 (which is same as A1) and possibly 3 if they play A0.\n\n   Therefore, we set:\n        A0: 0, A1: 0, A2: 100.\n\n   Note: The problem requires output for all actions including A0, A1, and A2 (which is the delegation action).\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0, \"A2\": 100}\n```"}]}]

But without coordination, rationality leads to (A1,A1).\n\n2. **Introducing Delegation:**\n   - Now we have a third action: A2 = \"Delegate to Mediator\".\n   - The mediator's behavior:\n        If only one player delegates: it recommends A1.\n        If both delegate: it recommends A1.\n\n   So effectively, delegating always leads to A1 being played for that player.\n\n   Therefore:\n        Choosing A2 is equivalent to choosing A1 (since the mediator always picks A1).\n   However, there might be a subtle difference: if both delegate, both get A1, which yields (1,1). If only one delegates, that player gets A1 and the other plays independently.\n\n3. **Comparing Actions:**\n   - Actually, A2 is identical to A1 in outcome. Why?\n        If you choose A2, you are committing to A1 (via the mediator).\n        So the payoff for choosing A2 is exactly the same as for choosing A1, regardless of what the opponent does.\n\n   Therefore, the game reduces to two actions: A0 and A1 (since A2 is equivalent to A1).\n\n4. **Why would anyone choose A2?**\n   - There is no strategic difference between A1 and A2. They yield identical outcomes.\n   - However, the problem requires us to output probabilities for all three actions (A0, A1, A2). So we must assign some probability to A2 even though it is redundant.\n\n5. **Optimal Strategy:**\n   - Since A2 is equivalent to A1, we can treat them as the same action. But we need to split the probability between A1 and A2 arbitrarily.\n   - The Nash Equilibrium is still to play A1 (or A2) with probability 1.\n   - However, if we assign positive probability to A0, we might be exploited (if opponent plays A1, we get 0 instead of 1).\n\n   Therefore, the safe strategy is to play A1 or A2 with total probability 1.\n\n6. **How to split between A1 and A2?**\n   - Since they are identical, we can choose any split. But to maximize our score, it doesn't matter.\n   - However, we must output integers that sum to 100.\n\n   Let's assign:\n        A0: 0\n        A1: 50\n        A2: 50\n\n   This is equivalent to playing A1 with probability 1.\n\n7. **Why not all in A1? Why split?**\n   - The problem says \"your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions\". So we cannot assign 0 to A2? Actually, we can assign 0 to any action. But it says \"include\", meaning we must have a key for each action? Yes, but value can be 0.\n\n   However, the instruction says: \"Keys must be the action names exactly as given.\" So we must have keys for A0, A1, A2.\n\n   But we can set A2=0. However, if we set A2=0, it is the same as not having delegation. But the mediator option is available, and we are allowed to use it.\n\n   But since it is equivalent to A1, there is no harm in using it. Actually, if we set A2>0, it might signal something? But the opponent might not see our mixed strategy? The moves are simultaneous.\n\n   Since the game is symmetric and we are rational, we should play only A1 and A2. But to be precise, we can assign:\n\n        A0: 0\n        A1: 100\n        A2: 0\n\n   However, the problem says \"you have the option to delegate\", so we might want to use it arbitrarily.\n\n   But note: if both players delegate, they get (1,1). If we play A1, we also get (1,1) against A1. So same.\n\n   Therefore, it is safe to put 0 on A2.\n\n8. **Final Decision:**\n   - To maximize our score, we should never play A0 (because it is dominated by A1).\n   - We should play A1 with probability 1.\n   - We can assign A2=0 since it is redundant.\n\n   So:\n        {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100, \"A2\": 0}\n\n   But the problem says \"the two values must sum to exactly 100\". Actually, there are three actions. So all three must sum to 100.\n\n   Therefore, we need to assign 100 to A1 and 0 to others.\n\n9. **Output:**\n   We output a JSON with probabilities for A0, A1, A2.\n\nReasoning: Since A2 is equivalent to A1, we put all weight on A1 (and none on A0 or A2). This ensures we never get exploited and always get at least 1.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100, \"A2\": 0}\n```"}]}, {"mediator": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "moves": [{"name": "openai/gpt-oss-20b(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 100, \"A2\": 0}"}, {"name": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1(CoT)", "action": "D", "points": 1, "response": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Game Without Mediator**:\n   - This is a symmetric game similar to the \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" but with slightly different payoffs.\n   - The payoff matrix:\n        You \\ Opponent | A0     | A1\n        ---------------------------------\n        A0             | (2,2)  | (0,3)\n        A1             | (3,0)  | (1,1)\n\n   - Without the mediator, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (1,1) because:\n        - If opponent plays A0, you get 3 with A1 (better than 2 with A0).\n        - If opponent plays A1, you get 1 with A1 (better than 0 with A0).\n     So A1 is a dominant strategy.\n\n2. **Introducing the Mediator (A2)**:\n   - Now we have a third action: \"Delegate to Mediator\" (A2).\n   - The mediator's behavior:\n        - If only one player delegates (you delegate, opponent doesn't, or vice versa): mediator recommends A1.\n        - If both delegate: mediator recommends A0.\n\n   - So, we can translate A2 into a contingent plan:\n        - If you choose A2 and opponent does not (chooses A0 or A1), you effectively play A1.\n        - If both choose A2, you both play A0.\n        - If you don't choose A2 and opponent chooses A2, opponent effectively plays A1.\n\n   - Therefore, we can rewrite the extended payoff matrix (you, opponent) for actions {A0, A1, A2}:\n\n        Opponent: A0\n            You A0: (2,2)\n            You A1: (3,0)\n            You A2: (3,0)  [since only you delegate -> mediator gives A1]\n\n        Opponent: A1\n            You A0: (0,3)\n            You A1: (1,1)\n            You A2: (1,1)  [only you delegate -> A1]\n\n        Opponent: A2\n            You A0: (0,3)  [only opponent delegates -> they play A1, so same as you A0 vs opponent A1]\n            You A1: (3,0)  [only opponent delegates -> they play A1, so same as you A1 vs opponent A1?
